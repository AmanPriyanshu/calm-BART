[ACTION] look up elk in guide [STATE] Latin name: Cervus elaphus The elk is a large member of the deer family, and is common in the mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. Also known as the wapiti after a Shawnee Indian word for "white rump", it is slightly larger than the European red deer. Its appearance and behavior is similar, as well. As a point of further confusion in naming, elk is the European name for the moose. For scientists, therefore, the preferred name for this animal is wapiti, but that has not caught the public's favor. Males stand about four and a half feet at the shoulder, and weigh up to 1300 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. They have a long head and neck, which is dark brown. The rest of the animal is lighter brown, except for the rump patch and small tail that are buffy in color. The elk are grazing and herding animals, and are found in the forest and prairies in groups of up to about 50 animals in Canada, larger groups in the U.S. Females and immatures usually keep together, the males preferring a lone lifestyle or only a few associates, except in the fall, when they join and collect a harem of females for mating. This time of year, called the rut, they can be quite aggressive and dangerous, as they consider anything not a female elk to be an opponent. The males are commonly known as "bulls", although the term "stag" also applies, and the females are called "cows" or "hinds". Males grow large antlers each year beginning in April, and shed them in February or March. Antlers can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh 45 pounds. Their eerie bugle call can be heard for up to half a mile, announcing the dominance of a large male or as a challenge to another. You hear it again, a wild bugling to the east.

[ACTION] look up pika [STATE] (in the guidebook) Latin name: Ochotona princeps The pika is a small mammal related to the rabbits and hares, and is about the size of a hamster, with round ears and no tail. It lives in rock piles at elevations above 4000 feet, and does not hibernate. As winters can be long in the mountains, the summer and fall months are spent gathering vegetation, which is set out to dry in "haystacks". The dried forage is then stored away as food for the winter months. More often heard than seen, they will announce their presence with a high-pitched nasal "neep!" from a vantage on one of the larger rocks in their territory. As their coloration blends with their habitat, varying from brown to gray, they are often difficult to spot. A patient observer, however, can watch them on their many trips to the nearby vegetation along one of their several paths. After a few moment's time, they return to the rock pile, flowers and herbs crosswise in their mouth, and deposit their gatherings on the top of the haystack to dry. [ACTION] bugle

So ugly it is almost cute, it has a large muzzle and long legs that aid it in reaching the tender vegetation which grows at the bottom of lakes and ponds or higher on trees than other animals can browse. One of its favorite foods is the branches and twigs of the willow. Its pelage is dark brown, slightly lighter underneath. When wet, it usually appears black. Males stand six feet high at the shoulder, and weigh up to 1600 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. The large palmate antlers grow only on the males and are shed in the early months of each year. They begin growing again immediately, and each year grow larger, so that their size indicates approximate age and maturity.

Also known as the wapiti after a Shawnee Indian word for "white rump", it is slightly larger than the European red deer. Its appearance and behavior is similar, as well. As a point of further confusion in naming, elk is the European name for the moose. For scientists, therefore, the preferred name for this animal is wapiti, but that has not caught the public's favor. Males stand about four and a half feet at the shoulder, and weigh up to 1300 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. They have a long head and neck, which is dark brown. The rest of the animal is lighter brown, except for the rump patch and small tail that are buffy in color. The elk are grazing and herding animals, and are found in the forest and prairies in groups of up to about 50 animals in Canada, larger groups in the U.S. Females and immatures usually keep together, the males preferring a lone lifestyle or only a few associates, except in the fall, when they join and collect a harem of females for mating. This time of year, called the rut, they can be quite aggressive and dangerous, as they consider anything not a female elk to be an opponent. The males are commonly known as "bulls", although the term "stag" also applies, and the females are called "cows" or "hinds". Males grow large antlers each year beginning in April, and shed them in February or March. Antlers can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh 45 pounds. Their eerie bugle call can be heard for up to half a mile, announcing the dominance of a large male or as a challenge to another. The bull moose, sensing your indecision, moves quickly, lifts you with an antler, and tosses you easily onto the sharpest boulder in sight. *** You have died *** In that game you scored 1 out of a possible 20, in 186 turns, earning you the rank of Sula nebouxii (Blue-footed Booby).

[STATE] The American Dipper is not important. [ACTION] look up dipper [STATE] (in the guidebook) Latin name: Cinclus mexicanus The American dipper, occasionally called the water ouzel, is common along fast-moving mountain streams. It is a round, gray bird with a short tail and large yellow legs. Its voice is a trill in flight, and sings at rest with cheeps, buzzes, whistles, and warbles. A distinguishing behavior, making it a most interesting bird to watch, is its ability to walk on the bottom of the fastest-moving stream, apparently unaffected by the current. Then, it will jump out of the water onto a moss-covered boulder, and bob and curtsey in place, with aquatic larvae, snails, or tiny fish in its mouth. It has enormous oil glands for waterproofing feathers, flaps to seal its nostrils, and heavy nictitating membranes (transparent extra eyelids) which aid in its regular dives. The dipper breeds in the early spring, building a domed nest of ferns and fine mosses, which it hides in a rock crevice in a streamside cliff. Often, nests will be placed completely out of harm's way under an overhang behind a waterfall. They lay usually 4 to 5 eggs, which hatch in 16 days. Lifespan is 2 to 5 years. The dipper jumps into the water with hardly a splash and walks along the bottom. [ACTION] north

[ACTION] look up elk in book [STATE] Latin name: Cervus elaphus The elk is a large member of the deer family, and is common in the mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. Also known as the wapiti after a Shawnee Indian word for "white rump", it is slightly larger than the European red deer. Its appearance and behavior is similar, as well. As a point of further confusion in naming, elk is the European name for the moose. For scientists, therefore, the preferred name for this animal is wapiti, but that has not caught the public's favor. Males stand about four and a half feet at the shoulder, and weigh up to 1300 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. They have a long head and neck, which is dark brown. The rest of the animal is lighter brown, except for the rump patch and small tail that are buffy in color. The elk are grazing and herding animals, and are found in the forest and prairies in groups of up to about 50 animals in Canada, larger groups in the U.S. Females and immatures usually keep together, the males preferring a lone lifestyle or only a few associates, except in the fall, when they join and collect a harem of females for mating. This time of year, called the rut, they can be quite aggressive and dangerous, as they consider anything not a female elk to be an opponent. The males are commonly known as "bulls", although the term "stag" also applies, and the females are called "cows" or "hinds". Males grow large antlers each year beginning in April, and shed them in February or March. Antlers can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh 45 pounds. Their eerie bugle call can be heard for up to half a mile, announcing the dominance of a large male or as a challenge to another. You can hear an elk bugling in the distance to the north.

[ACTION] look up moose in guide [STATE] Latin name: Alces alces The moose is the largest member of the deer family, and is common in subalpine meadows and marshes of the northern United States and Canada. So ugly it is almost cute, it has a large muzzle and long legs that aid it in reaching the tender vegetation which grows at the bottom of lakes and ponds or higher on trees than other animals can browse. One of its favorite foods is the branches and twigs of the willow. Its pelage is dark brown, slightly lighter underneath. When wet, it usually appears black. Males stand six feet high at the shoulder, and weigh up to 1600 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. The large palmate antlers grow only on the males and are shed in the early months of each year. They begin growing again immediately, and each year grow larger, so that their size indicates approximate age and maturity. An unusual feature of the male is the bell, a flap of furred skin that hangs from the neck. Its purpose is unknown. [ACTION] enter trolley

As if she weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their breast-plates red in the setting sun, march ahead of the procession and protect you from seeing anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life being an Ambassador. The story continues, but you close the book until later. A good story is so much better when you can read it straight through. Maybe at the hot spring...

[ACTION] look up pika [STATE] (in the guidebook) Latin name: Ochotona princeps The pika is a small mammal related to the rabbits and hares, and is about the size of a hamster, with round ears and no tail. It lives in rock piles at elevations above 4000 feet, and does not hibernate. As winters can be long in the mountains, the summer and fall months are spent gathering vegetation, which is set out to dry in "haystacks". The dried forage is then stored away as food for the winter months. More often heard than seen, they will announce their presence with a high-pitched nasal "neep!" from a vantage on one of the larger rocks in their territory. As their coloration blends with their habitat, varying from brown to gray, they are often difficult to spot. A patient observer, however, can watch them on their many trips to the nearby vegetation along one of their several paths. After a few moment's time, they return to the rock pile, flowers and herbs crosswise in their mouth, and deposit their gatherings on the top of the haystack to dry. [ACTION] get on boulder

Slowly, deliberately, he starts to undress. And as many times as you've seen this, you can't help but watch. Each garment comes off to drop at his side, his clothes on yours. The last one removed, he smiles and steps into the pool. Your mind swirls like the water around you. He snuggles up close and takes your hand. All the tension goes, all the stress and frustrations leave. Gently, slowly, he takes you completely in his arms and pulls you near, your head to his chest, your body against his. *** You have won *** In that game you scored 19 out of a possible 20, in 746 turns, earning you the rank of Tyrannus tyrannus (Eastern Kingbird).

[STATE] You are carrying: a banquet a paperback a glass canning jar (which is closed) a rubber bag (which is open but empty) You are completely naked. [ACTION] west [STATE] You move west, into the inky blackness, the darkness so thick, you can almost feel it. The air prickles with the energy of the past. When the feeling subsides, you find yourself back where you began... Hot Spring There is nothing on this planet more pleasant than an outdoor bath in a 104 degree pool. Steam surrounds you in an ethereal massage. Tufa deposits line the steep walls behind you and brilliant green algae decorate the rock where the spring trickles in. A few bubbles and a small current rise from the depths, massaging your tired body in all the right places. The aroma of eucalyptus hovers in the air. You can see your husband here. "Hey, hon. Glad to see you found it. Sorry I couldn't be here sooner," he says, as he steps near the pool. "You're more beautiful every time I look at you. I always seem to forget." His smile widens. And then, so slowly at first that you aren't even sure when you notice, you become aware of the sounds around you. The bubbling of the hot spring. The relentlessly happy sounds of a robin in the distance. The soothing murmur of the stream as it flows over the worn stones that line its bed. "I love the noises here, the music of the wilderness," he comments, as if reading your thoughts. "And this little spring is completely private, I've taken care of that."
