The brothers' dormitory lies to the east, between the calefactory in the southeast and the belltower in the northeast. The church commands from the north, its spires reaching up to Heaven.

[STATE] Written in a slothful scrawl: I would normally write in my journal, but in my increasing paranoia, I have hidden it. Now, I kick myself as it seems so far away. Everything is so far away: such a burden. The father came to visit me earlier; he is not the same man I knew and respected. He looked at me with murder in his eyes. I would tell Lucca, but I am scared. No, I am lazy. I do not care if he kills me. I would do it myself were I not such a coward. A wolf howls in the distance. A hungry, plaintive sound.
