Though truly a Classical artist, he is often regarded as Pre-Raphaelite due to his obvious affection for literature, myth, romanticism, and nature. Waterhouse's works are known for their use of colour, light, and intense attention to detail. Waterhouse moved to England early in life and studied first in his father's studio, then later at the Royal Academy Schools. He became an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885, and a Full Academician in 1895. His initial paintings depicted true life subjects, but he soon began to focus his work in more poetic realms, borrowing from the writings of Homer, Shakespeare, and Tennyson, among others. Waterhouse continued painting up until the time of his death in 1917. [ACTION] touch painting

Beneath your fingertips, you can feel the topography of the paint... its contours, the changes in texture, and the varying directions which accompany each brushstroke. When you try to take your hand away from the painting, you realise that you are powerless to do so. You begin to feel something, a sensation indescribable but not at all unpleasant. You feel a warmth slowly spreading through your fingers, into your body. Soon it envelopes you completely, drawing you closer... ...and you feel yourself stepping into the painting. Inside the painting entitled "The Crystal Ball" Glancing about, you notice that everything here is as it appeared in the painting. To the north is the elegant woman standing between the table and chair, and beyond her the window, but your new point of view from inside the painting allows you to see the rest of the room as well. A second window is set in the eastern wall, and a matching chair can be seen opposite the table from its mate. A large trunk sits in the northwest corner of the room, and a looking-glass can be seen to the southeast. Behind you, to the south, is a door. Slowly, the woman opens her eyes and lifts her gaze to meet your own. A knowing smile plays across her lips. "I've been watching you," she says softly. "You think yourself off course, lost from the world you know and understand." She pauses, looks into the crystal, and begins to speak again. "I see a path for you, Wanderer. Its course is not yet determined, but its ending is clear. You will find that which you seek."  She lifts her eyes again, her fingers still playing delicately across the surface of the orb. "I am Sophronia, daughter of Aisling, and I knew you would find me." She looks at you expectantly. [ACTION] examine orb

[STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. The Green Coast, Ministry of Colonial Finance, 11:04 PM, June 12th, 1942. "General Marchgrave's office is on the second floor of the Palace," says Helzog, "overlooking the Gardens. He is in possession of a mask: black, smooth-sanded wood, simple in design. It should be on display. His temporary absence is our best chance to steal it. The front of the Palace will be guarded, so circle through the jungle and approach the back of the Gardens. Once you have found the mask, bring it back to me as quickly as possible." Helzog looks up, blinks. "Stay out of sight, Alain. You are our Ministry's sole agent who specializes in such delicate matters." --- HEY, JINGO! An IntroComp Entry (c) 2002 by Caleb Wilson Please type ABOUT and CREDITS if you haven't before.
