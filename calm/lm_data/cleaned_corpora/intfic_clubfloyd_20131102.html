I keep meaning to look up when she died but I haven't had time. "When people see her, she looks like a teenage girl in pigtails. I don't think she shows up covered in blood or anything like that; she's just a sad girl. Obviously a lot of the time she's invisible though. "Some of the evidence that we have for her existence includes: - sounds of footsteps and a girl crying when nobody else is in the church - cold spots in rooms, rooms that suddenly become cold for no reason - stuff goes missing, then shows up again - you see someone at the end of the hallway but when you get to the end of the hallway there's nobody there - basically everybody has seen her out of the corner of their eye at some point "Debate continues on the subject of how Jennie died. Popular theories state that she jumped off of the church steeple, or she drank poison, or used a space heater to carbon monoxide herself. According to one explanation she died accidentally, because she was using a Ouija board, but that theory is idiotic.

Lying open on a podium is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags. To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is south of here, but that's none of your concern currently. [ACTION] north [STATE] . N. N Sanctuary This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews. Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony. It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and lifeless. Altar A few steps up from the pews to the south are the preacher's pulpit, the altar, and the American and Christian flags. Behind them, to the north, is a tiny doorway. On the altar are two candles. A large cross hangs high on the wall above the altar. Back Room This is a far cry from the grandeur of the sanctuary. The walls are covered in some kind of dark wood panels, but they're shabby and windowless, and the floor is bare concrete. A huge wooden chest and a closet full of robes take up one wall. You can head back out to the altar to the south, or try the sliding door to the north. A stack of hymnals is crammed into one corner. Some more ectoplasm is smeared on the floor. [ACTION] north

I mean, just because you don't believe in ghosts doesn't mean you're not gonna see one. "So, yeah. That's three things." "So, yeah. That's three things." Robin & Orchid An exercise in photojournalism by Ryan Veeder & Emily Boegheim  Nursery Sharon, in her wisdom, decided that everybody should sleep in this cramped corner of the church basement. Battered toys spill out of the toybox and across the floor, piling up in a corner of the room. Cupboards are mounted high on the walls, out of reach of tiny fingers, and an enormous blue recliner sits underneath them. It's already dark outside, and the doors west to the basement stairway and south are dark as well. Your sleeping bag is lying on a tidy patch of floor, ready for when you finish your investigation. Orchid is lounging around, lecturing you. "You'd better hold onto this," she says, handing you the camera, "you're the official photographer. Just don't forget, if you see something that might be evidence of a ghost, make sure you take a photo of it." You slip the camera strap around your neck. [ACTION] up [STATE]  Steeple The inside of the church steeple is a cold concrete cube with cinderblock walls. There's one window, but it's been boarded up. You jump. There's a boy sitting on the floor, smirking at you. It's Aiden Kingsley. The ghost's glowing dress lies in a heap nearby. It doesn't look very ghostly now. Aiden stands up. "Hey, hey, Robin! Are you enjoying your evening?" he asks, smiling. You are not smiling. "So you're the ghost." "Well, yes. Well, no. I am not a dead person. Heh. But I portrayed the ghost you saw, yes." "Does Orchid know?" "Does Orchid know. Does Orchid know? What a well-chosen detective question." Aiden looks down the trapdoor behind you. "Do you think we could continue this conversation downstairs? It's really freaking cold up here." [ACTION] down

[ACTION] down [STATE]  Balcony Standing here, you have a good view of the altar and most of the sanctuary. A low wall with a railing along the top prevents accidents, though it probably also obscures the view for anyone sitting on the balcony pews. A projector is mounted at one end of the pews, pointing down towards the front of the sanctuary. Behind the pews you can see the ladder up to the steeple, and a narrow staircase leads back down to the sanctuary. The orange box is sitting upside down on the floor. A tangled heap of bars and cables is lying near the edge of the balcony. You look back to make sure Aiden has followed you. "Yes. Now I'll tell you the answer to your question. Of course Orchid knows. This was all Orchid's idea. She was very naughty. And I'm not even supposed to be here, so I should probably get going." He tries to slip past you, but you grab his arm. Aiden yelps like a dog. "What's your problem?" "You're not going anywhere. I've got a few more questions." "Then can you get your hands off me first? You're gonna break my arm." "Sure." You let go of his arm. "Let's get going." You know exactly where the two of you are going, but you should probably keep that a surprise. [ACTION] down

[ACTION] down [STATE]  Balcony Stairs There isn't really any room in here for anything except the stairs up to the balcony, but that hasn't stopped someone from putting a potted plant in the corner. If you can avoid tripping over the plant, an archway to the west leads back out into the sanctuary. Aiden mopes along after you. "Yeah, Orchid brought the idea to me. She said if she could write a story about a real ghost, then maybe people would actually read the newspaper. Heh. But I told her I'd help her." "Why?" "For the heck of it, primarily." [ACTION] west

[ACTION] west [STATE]  Sanctuary This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews. Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony. It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and lifeless. Aiden follows you in. "Originally, she was just going to let me in the church during the sleepover, and we'd just spend the night taking a bunch of ghost pictures. However. Then we found out that you were going to be the other newspaper girl staying the night. And Orchid said you'd never go along with it. So we had to change the plan." [ACTION] south

[ACTION] south [STATE]  Narthex The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as welcoming as possible. A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags. To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is south of here, but that's none of your concern currently. Aiden follows you in. As you enter the narthex, Orchid strolls in through the front door of the church. When she sees Aiden, her eyes go wide. "Aiden! What are you doing here?" "Hey. Don't bother," Aiden snaps. "I've already told her everything. Or almost everything. Heh." Orchid rushes up to Aiden with her fists clenched. "You're lying. There's no proof. All you can prove is that you broke into the church and tried to scare us." "Well, no," says Aiden. "I can prove some other things. I have the receipts. For the makeup and everything. Because you had to use a credit card, idiot." Orchid goes quiet. "Well, we can talk about this in the morning," Aiden says, and he makes for the southern exit—but you grab his arm, and he cries out softly. "Yeah. Your way is probably better." [ACTION] brief

She said you're too much of a straight arrow. Those weren't her exact words. What were your exact words, Orchid?" Orchid is looking down at her shoes. Aiden shrugs. "She said something really nasty." No time to explore now. Sharon needs to know what's been going on. Main Floor Stairway Orchid and Aiden follow along. "But Orchid had this other great idea. She figured if we went a little further with the hoax, we could get you to believe the ghost was real. Heh." "I wasn't trying to trick you!" Orchid pleads. "I just wanted it to be authentic. I wanted it to be a great story." "Sure, and then the great ghost story would be in the newspaper with the name of the most trustworthy reporter on staff on it, and Orchid's name too." Aiden chuckles. "But, looks like that didn't work out." [ACTION] down
