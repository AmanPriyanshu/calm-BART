It had been filled with colourful plates and cups and seldom-used cookery books and odds and ends that the family had brought back from various holidays that couldn't find another home. Now the brown boxes on the floor and table, taped and anonymous, only serve to remind you of how much there is left to do before the removal van arrives next week. The pile of boxes seems to be higher than yesterday, but that's ok, because the room seems to have grown to accommodate them. On a plinth in the corner, a rubber plant brushes the ceiling.
