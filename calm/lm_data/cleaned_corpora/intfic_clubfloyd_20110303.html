[ACTION] examine tool [STATE] This was the first artifact that you came across that let you know you were on the right trail to find the missing dig crew. Of alien origin, it doesn't resemble an earthbound digging tool such as a bladed shovel.

I suppose that helps you dig "down" in a near-null-gravity planetoid core, which is where you happen to find yourself. [ACTION] examine suit

Your heart thumping, you find some kind of stupid courage somewhere in yourself, and push off, taking the ride wherever it goes. The corkscrew slide seems to draw you downward with magnetic power. It can't be gravity -- gravity should be getting less and less accelerative the closer you go to planetoid core, but within seconds you're twisting fast enough to become dizzy. Your hands uselessly try to grab hold, but there's not enough friction. Or too much -- your hands feel like they're burning through your gloves before you can tell there's any slowing of your momentum at all. You feel your vision collapsing to a pinpoint, and everything is about to go black, when suddenly everything bursts wide open and bright as day. Pluto - Central Core - Brain Tree You are tumbling and spinning in an effective zero gravity environment, in a place big enough to fit two or three mining ships end to end. Giant, ancient crystals grow in funguslike clusters around the spheric volume, spiking up toward the center, looking every bit like the inside of a geode. Asymmetrically, a single great fossilized tree trunk grows from the far side of the cavernous space from you, with branches that twist and curl and spread and go straight and turn back again -- some kind of null gravity growth that you've never seen in an earthbound tree, which has to contend with gravity and atmosphere and winds. Here in a vacuum, other rules of growth seem to apply. While it was alive, that is. It does look fossilized. It doesn't, however, look dead. [ACTION] examine tree
