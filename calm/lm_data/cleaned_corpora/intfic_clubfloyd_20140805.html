The full text can be found at [LINK] The game starts When you start a game, you will first see an introduction, usually consisting of one or a few screenfuls of text, giving you some background on who you are, where you are, and perhaps even what your objectives in the game are. Whenever the game has printed a screenful of text, it will wait until you press ENTER or some other key, so that you get a chance to read everything before it scrolls off the top of the screen. How to interact When the introduction is over, you will get a prompt, usually ">", but it may be a little different from game to game. The prompt means that the game is now waiting for you to tell it what you want to do. You do this by typing in imperative commands, as if you were commanding someone. Let's say the introduction told you that you are in a kitchen, and that you can see a closed glass jar standing on the kitchen counter. Commands you could try at this point include TAKE THE JAR, or OPEN THE JAR, or perhaps EXAMINE THE JAR (Throughout this document, things that are written in capital letters are complete commands that can be typed into an IF game. They don't have to be typed in capital letters when entered into a game). If you want to, you can skip the articles: TAKE JAR will work just at well as TAKE THE JAR. If there are several different jars you could mean, the game may ask you which one you mean. Just type one or more words that uniquely identifies one of the items. For instance, if the game says "Which jar do you mean, the blue glass jar or the green glass jar?", you might reply BLUE to take the blue one. You can also choose to ignore the question altogether, just typing a new command. [Please press SPACE.] [ACTION] p

[STATE]  Entrance Hall Extremely spacious. It is its best with a half-dozen servants in livery. The floor is Italian marble. The main staircase ascends to the corridor on the second floor, and a smaller version leads down into the dim basement. Doors also open north and northeast. An old gothic door framed in stone leads west. A sad heap of used yellow brocade huddles on the floor here. On the wall is one of those mechanical clocks that pop open on the hour, allowing the ingenious internal figures out to play. The cuckoo clock ticks sullenly.

Bookshelves line the walls, reaching above your head, leaving exits only east and south. A clockwork model of the universe stands in one corner. On one wall is an enormous portrait of the Count's father, from the hand of Hyacinthe Rigaud. [ACTION] east

The plastered ceiling is several times your height. The air now is cool and deep, the sunlight glancing through the windows and scattering from the chandelier, putting points of light at your feet, over the table, across the painted wallpaper and the handsome wood paneling. Woodworked columns frame the exits west and southwest. Heavy double doors open east to the kitchen. [ACTION] east

D'Envers strides towards Marie, and she swings the pillow in his face; it hits so hard that his head snaps back and his nose streams blood. He falls without even crying out. Marie stands over him for a moment, startled. She leans forward and touches D'Envers' wrist, and then stands up and kicks him hard in the ribs. Only then does she climb out the window... [MORE] Ten days later Your townhouse in Paris Marie sips from the cup of coffee in her hand. "I still do not understand," she says, "why you were at the estate in the first place." You shrug. "I had-- certain obligations."  Her eyes meet yours, and she waits. "Gambling debts," you elaborate. "I was hoping your father would advance--" "I did not know you gambled." "Under ordinary circumstances, I do not. I was-- led into it, in a way, by an acquaintance, and found myself indebted through him to the Baron D'Envers. He became quite unpleasant about the matter."  You examine your fingernails. "In the event, it seems that I am absolved of these debts. I doubt his heir will press them." She nods. You consider whether to tell her the rest of what you learned. But she speaks first, frowning into her cup. "I should tell you, Pierre, it might not be a coincidence, your trouble with D'Envers."  She bites her lower lip. "You see, he was pressing me to marry him, and he might have had the impression-- that is to say, he might have thought--" You raise your right eyebrow. "If you used me as an excuse, Marie, do not worry about it," you say, with great generosity. "I have been the subject of more embarrassing rumors." She opens her mouth again, and you smile... *** You have won *** In that game you scored 118 out of a possible 125, in 1333 turns, giving you the rank of returned prodigal.
