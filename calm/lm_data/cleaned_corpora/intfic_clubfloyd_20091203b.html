Cold, wet droplets suddenly pummel your skin as a furious snowstorm erupts. Thousands upon thousands of snowflakes swirl about in a blinding blizzard. You stumble off of the path in blindness and tumble down the side of the mountain ... You awake finding yourself staring at a silvery round orb in a midnight blue sky. You are lying on your back in a small forest clearing covered for the most part in soft, powdery snow.

The scraping of metal becomes louder and louder, and suddenly an old mining cart filled with small grey stones emerges from the cave entrance. A stocky, pug-nosed dwarf with a lit candle on his hat pushes the cart along the tracks from behind. Quite oblivious or unconcerned by your presence, he continues pushing the cart until it reaches the stone pile where he dumps his load of stones.

A large mountain rises into the starry night sky to the south and you see many others beyond.

You scamper up the mountain side to the trail which gleams brilliantly in the full moonlight and run towards home with all of the strength left that you are able to muster. You return home to a teary reunion with your worried parents. And to your great surprise and delight, Sander was well enough to sit at the fireside awaiting your return. When you reveal the handsome shoes you carried through the entire adventure as a solstice gift for him, his eyes gleam with giddy admiration. You feel certain that he will recover soon to join you in all of your games and mischief as once before. Your mother brings out the meager solstice feast she had been saving, and all of you sit around the hearth to celebrate the final moments of this solstice night. Sander smiles with delight as you relate all of your incredible trials and adventures in the winter wonderland, and your parents exchange bewildered glances. Suddenly, a burlap bag tied in twine arcs through the open window to land in front of the little spruce tree with a thud. Your parents carefully open the bag and dump out the contents. They nearly fall over in shock as gold pieces spill out onto the floor. You run to the window and poke your head outside. A damp breeze rustles your hair as you look to the east. You hear soft jingling bells among the distant clop of horse hoofs and are barely able to see a fading figure on a white horse disappear into the rising dawn. ***  H a v e  a  J o y o u s  W i n t e r  S o l s t i c e !  *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, read about the MAKING of Winter Wonderland, view the CREDITS, or QUIT?

[STATE] As you walk out of the tunnel of brambles to the southeast, you are much relieved to find yourself in a wide open area with the thicket behind you. A large mountain rises into the starry night sky to the south and you see many others beyond. With a gasp of delight, you recognize that a snow-covered trail running along the mountainside is the very same one upon which you had ventured into town so many times. You scamper up the mountain side to the trail which gleams brilliantly in the full moonlight and run towards home with all of the strength left that you are able to muster. You return home to a teary reunion with your worried parents. And to your great surprise and delight, Sander was well enough to sit at the fireside awaiting your return. When you reveal the handsome shoes you carried through the entire adventure as a solstice gift for him, his eyes gleam with giddy admiration. You feel certain that he will recover soon to join you in all of your games and mischief as once before. Your mother brings out the meager solstice feast she had been saving, and all of you sit around the hearth to celebrate the final moments of this solstice night. Sander smiles with delight as you relate all of your incredible trials and adventures in the winter wonderland, and your parents exchange bewildered glances. Suddenly, a burlap bag tied in twine arcs through the open window to land in front of the little spruce tree with a thud. Your parents carefully open the bag and dump out the contents. They nearly fall over in shock as gold pieces spill out onto the floor. You run to the window and poke your head outside. A damp breeze rustles your hair as you look to the east. You hear soft jingling bells among the distant clop of horse hoofs and are barely able to see a fading figure on a white horse disappear into the rising dawn. ***  H a v e  a  J o y o u s  W i n t e r  S o l s t i c e !  *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, read about the MAKING of Winter Wonderland, view the CREDITS, or QUIT?
