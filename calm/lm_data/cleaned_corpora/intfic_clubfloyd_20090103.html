A simple enough idea; graft firefly genes into the DNA of common lawn grass.  Primitive tests on tobacco plants had proved the concept worked; the rest was only a matter of commerce.  (Ancient economic theory was strange in many ways, but you're as well informed as any modern scholar can be). And by the end of the Ancient era, almost every family home had its glowgrass lawn.

North American President Jarvies Erlmann today denied rumours that tactical nuclear devices could be used to fight the viral mutagen popularly known as the Green Plague. "The idea was floated at a strategy briefing," Erlmann's online avatar announced during his live press conference at vr.whitehouse.gov, "but I can definitely state that it is an unfeasible option and will not be applied.  The North American government will continue to provide financial and scientific assistance to the state of Europe in dealing with this threat, but detonating nuclear weapons on foreign soil would constitute a breach of the 2012 Geneva Treaty.  For God's sake, people, we're talking about vaporising whole cities!  Let's get a perspective!" Erlmann's position, while predictable from his stance on human rights, seems precarious given the overwhelming support in the United Nations for drastic measures against the Plague.

[ACTION] push sunburst [STATE] There's a brief hum from the console, and the green button starts glowing. Marie's projected image appears on the seat beside you. Marie flicks in and out of view for a few moments, then settles into a sitting posture beside you.  She glances around the vehicle's interior - presumably, the skycar has concealed visual pickups to give projected images the power of sight - and then nods. "Okay.  You've got the electrics running.  Now you need to give the drive some power.  That lever there is the main throttle - pull it to increase power and push to slacken off.  Steering could be a problem - I'll try to cut past the overrides and do it myself." Seeing your expression, Marie grins.  "Why the surprise?  I'm a natural with cars.  You should have seen me fly this before...  when I was...  whatever.  Well, I'm okay now.  I'll be fine." [ACTION] examine coil

The skycar continues to follow the valley's curve, gradually heading towards a forested ridge.  Below, you get a clear view of the jungle: tall green palms with leafy fronds, clustering thornbushes, strange contorted ferns.  All of them glowing, a soft pale green. Marie looks down at the jungle, wonderingly.  "This was a city," she breathes.  "All this was city.  Suburbs, housing estates, skycars, towers...  all gone.  I don't believe it."  She turns away, as if unwilling to reveal any more emotion. [ACTION] take yellow

"Mmmm," she says, "But I don't have the processor power for this right now.  And besides, you don't want me.  You want a girl who's alive." The skycar tops the ridge and breaks through into a scene of devastation.  A smouldering crater, carved out of the jungle by the doomed dropship's crash.  There's no wreckage; a turbine implosion never leaves more than scattered plasma.  You watch silently as the crater passes by beneath.  If your team were lucky, they had a few seconds to activate the escape wormhole, and make their own way home. If not... Marie looks over at you, her face gentle.  "So, it was true.  You had friends too."  She looks back at the console for a moment, then at you.  "Lost?  Or...  no.  There's still hope, isn't there?" [ACTION] examine me

[ACTION] examine me [STATE] You're a world-renowned xenohistorian and student of Ancient artifacts.  And you're in reasonably good shape, given the mess this field trip has turned into. The skycar leaves the crater, passing over a sheer cliff - recently fractured by the dropship's blast wave - into a river valley that winds its way out towards more familiar territory.  The setting sun slowly drops out of sight, leaving a trail of soft green light as the glowgrass jungle switches on its full bioluminescence.  Bright moving dots mark the passage of birds and predators.  You hope Marie doesn't ask about the taller ones; or notice the drop of greenish, sparkling, blood oozing from the tiny cut on your arm.  Tommorow will be time enough for everything. "Hope," continues Marie, quietly, watching the jungle swallow the night.  "Yes. I guess that's all any of us has." You nod, silently.
