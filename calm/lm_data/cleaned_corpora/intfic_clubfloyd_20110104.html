While I was working at the McDonalds drivethrough he was very interested to listen to my ideas as he was waiting for his happy meal. When he heard my theory on 18th century chemistry and its possible usage in geothermal energy, he instantly offered me a job. That is when I found out he is the billionaire owner of M.O.U.C.E. ! Already he has drilled five tunnels 200 km into the earth and is busy with the sixth! Yes, yes, I know. 200 km is much deeper than the original plan we discussed but he is a man of such vision and vast resources that it is hard to say no, even if it is very dangerous. But I have many contingency plans to make sure nothing bad will happen. Mr. Goldtooth does not allow me to go out of my room for fear of danger to me. He is so kind. My room is lovely though with a comfortable bed, all the equipment I need to do my experiments and a computer. Sometimes he requires me to keep an eye on the compound through the surveillance system but that gives me an opportunity to remember you mother. There is not much to do for entertainment so I have started doing random experiments with my chemical equipment. So far I have discovered an easy-to-make poisonous gas, a new precious metal and a way to make candy floss! I love you and I hope to see you soon. Your son. Bounfiglio [ACTION] search suit

After a few minutes you notice that the Automatic Motion Detection is activated. On screen you see Agent Powers, dressed in a phsychadelic green suit, walking through the compound. He seems very familiar with the surroundings. You watch as he walks into Manfred Goldtooth's office and they give each other a big bear hug! Then Goldtooth takes out a big suitcase filled with money and gives it to Powers. The traitor! He has sold you out. You bet he is the reason why you and agent sleeping beauty was captured (your own incompetence not withstanding). Powers retires to the empty office where he gleefully continues counting his money and singing. The screen returns to normal. [ACTION] type escape

To make it is a two step process. First combine carbon and lead to start the catalyzation process. This will produce a green substance (I am thinking of calling it CIOSAMINA, after mother off course). Then combine this green substance with Platina and it will produce the super-explosive gas. Note: The gas will only explode when it comes into contact with oxygen. [ACTION] open gapdoor
