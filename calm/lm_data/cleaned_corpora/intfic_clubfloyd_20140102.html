Grasping the ropes and forcing yourself not to look down, you began to climb.  A few yards up you paused for breath, and longed just to close your eyes and cling on for dear life until the storm had passed; but you felt the eyes of the captain and half the crew were upon you: it behoved you to play the part of a fearless officer, so on you went. A little over half-way up, you caught sight of something ahead; but it looked more like a band of fog than a stretch of land.  It at once struck you as absurd, not only that a bank of sea-mist should collect here, but even more that it would not be at once shredded by the gale. Overcome by curiosity you took out your telescope, trying to do your best to keep your balance on the rigging while examining the strange sight.  It did look like a band of mist.  But at the next moment a sudden gust made the Niobe heel over to starboard, and in a heart-stopping moment you felt your feet slip free of the lines.  For a moment you hung there by a single hand, and then that too was wrenched free and you fell. You hit the surface of the sea and carried straight on down.  To begin with, you thought that was it, and almost resigned yourself to drown; but then, as your lungs felt ready to burst, your survival instinct took over and you struggled to regain the surface.

All four roads lead between grim, grey buildings; the road to the east looks quite short, while that to the west leads up a distant hill.  The roads to north and south look as if they run on quite a way, but just a short way to the south you can see a hanging inn-sign. Two men smelling strongly of fish stride past to the south.

But perhaps the most striking feature of this part of the cliff is the thick grass that covers it; something about the soil causes it to grow in a spectrum of greens from almost yellow to virtually turquoise, creating an effect akin to a patterned carpet.
