[ACTION] spells [STATE] You are the master of the following spells: blorb:   The blorb spell lets you safely protect a small object, as though in a strongbox. You wouldn't think it was so useful, but when was the last time you saw a strongbox? cleesh:   The cleesh spell lets you change something into a small amphibian. It's kind of fun being a stereotypical witch out of a kid's TV show. exex:   The exex spell lets you make things and/or people go faster. Hence the name. filfre:   The filfre spell lets you create gratuitous fireworks. Fortunately for party hosts, it works even better when you're drunk. frotz:   The frotz spell allows you to cause something to give off light. You love this spell. No more do you have to travel by the light of your cell phone! gnusto:   The gnusto spell lets you write a spell into a spellbook. You, like most magicians, dislike it; you never reveal your secrets to the world. It's the only leg up you've got on the bastards. gondar:   The gondar spell lets you put out an open flame. It makes you pretty popular at parties. guncho:   The guncho spell lets you banish someone to another plane of existence. In theory. In practice, it does absolutely nothing for you. You're sure there's some crappy cop-out excuse, like this convention room is actually the meeting point of every possible plane of existence, making them geometrically -- technically -- the same plane, but you're pretty sure you just can't make it work. izyuk:   The izyuk spell lets you fly. It also works on other people, you guess, but when you're got a flying spell you are keeping that shit for yourself, OK? krebf:   The krebf spell lets you repair willful damage to something. It's made you far too careless for comfort. kulcad:   The kulcad spell allows you to dispel another spell. You love do-overs. melbor:   The melbor spell lets you protect a magic user from harm from an evil being. You've had to duck into the bathroom and cast it at least three times this afternoon. nitfol:   The nitfol spell allows you to converse with the beasts in their own language. It is the only reason why you have not yet been fired. ozmoo:   The ozmoo spell allows you to make something survive unnatural death. No, you don't know if it works in the afterlife and aren't keen to find out. rezrov:   The rezrov spell lets you open things, even locked or enchanted things. It works either literally or figuratively, but you don't like to use it literally much after you accidentally split your best friend's goldfish in two. vaxum:   The vaxum spell lets you make a hostile creature your friend. It is the other reason why you have not yet been fired. zifmia:   The zifmia spells lets you magically summon a being. Out of all of your spells, it is among the most likely to get you arrested.

She holds up a small leather-bound book, sort of in tatters. "Like this, for instance. It's supposedly real vellum, or vegan fake vellum, or something -- anyway, it's legit. I got it at one of the booths, and I'd always wanted a spellbook of my own, you know? But then some asshole ripped it out of my hands and tore it up." She sighs. "I really wanted to get back at him, too, but he just stormed off. Him and his stupid hair and his really stupid T-shirt." Your gaze shifts over to Brody for a second.

[ACTION] spells [STATE] You are the master of the following spells: blorb:   The blorb spell lets you safely protect a small object, as though in a strongbox. You wouldn't think it was so useful, but when was the last time you saw a strongbox? cleesh:   The cleesh spell lets you change something into a small amphibian. It's kind of fun being a stereotypical witch out of a kid's TV show. exex:   The exex spell lets you make things and/or people go faster. Hence the name. filfre:   The filfre spell lets you create gratuitous fireworks. Fortunately for party hosts, it works even better when you're drunk. frotz:   The frotz spell allows you to cause something to give off light. You love this spell. No more do you have to travel by the light of your cell phone! gnusto:   The gnusto spell lets you write a spell into a spellbook. You, like most magicians, dislike it; you never reveal your secrets to the world. It's the only leg up you've got on the bastards. gondar:   The gondar spell lets you put out an open flame. It makes you pretty popular at parties. guncho:   The guncho spell lets you banish someone to another plane of existence. In theory. In practice, it does absolutely nothing for you. You're sure there's some crappy cop-out excuse, like this convention room is actually the meeting point of every possible plane of existence, making them geometrically -- technically -- the same plane, but you're pretty sure you just can't make it work. izyuk:   The izyuk spell lets you fly. It also works on other people, you guess, but when you're got a flying spell you are keeping that shit for yourself, OK? krebf:   The krebf spell lets you repair willful damage to something. It's made you far too careless for comfort. kulcad:   The kulcad spell allows you to dispel another spell. You love do-overs. melbor:   The melbor spell lets you protect a magic user from harm from an evil being. You've had to duck into the bathroom and cast it at least three times this afternoon. nitfol:   The nitfol spell allows you to converse with the beasts in their own language. It is the only reason why you have not yet been fired. ozmoo:   The ozmoo spell allows you to make something survive unnatural death. No, you don't know if it works in the afterlife and aren't keen to find out. rezrov:   The rezrov spell lets you open things, even locked or enchanted things. It works either literally or figuratively, but you don't like to use it literally much after you accidentally split your best friend's goldfish in two. vaxum:   The vaxum spell lets you make a hostile creature your friend. It is the other reason why you have not yet been fired. zifmia:   The zifmia spells lets you magically summon a being. Out of all of your spells, it is among the most likely to get you arrested.

I'm sorry to say that beings that powerful have not existed since the Early Times. Not to put a damper on things, but -- we're doomed." With a hint of resignation, he adds, "well, at least you can say good-bye."

The energy flows between them once more, creating a Trinity barrier between the IF community and the hordes of shambling Farmvillains. Market Forces conspire to bring down the defenses, but David Cornelson casts Textfyre Balls at them, driving them off. In the midst of it all, Zarf casts the elaborate Glkian Ritual of Unity (a ritual that, truth be told, no one else understands quite so well).

Jason Scott, dressed in fine Victorian regalia, waves his hand and a silence falls over the crowd. The lights in the room fade, and you barely catch sight of a metallic glint before you are enveloped by darkness. Surrounded by friends, you have no worry about grues. [ACTION] look

"Greetings, my brave wizard," she says to you, nodding in appreciation of your wardrobe choices.  "I honor your courage in having made the journey here.

And you, my dear wizard, you shall be a part of that.  Take this," she says, "...and don't forget to catch the >Get Lamp premier this evening."

[STATE] You're in the line to nowhere, probably. A sexy, tall chick in tight leather pants suddenly walks up to you. She is unlike any of the mere mortals in the line with you.  Her skin glows actinically. Her hair is thick, flowing over her shoulders and down her back like glorious strands of ebony-colored fettuccine. "Greetings, my brave wizard," she says to you, nodding in appreciation of your wardrobe choices.  "I honor your courage in having made the journey here.  You have travelled from afar, braving jetlag to join us for the time of reckoning.  The rest of the gaming community will come to appreciate the glory of interactive fiction... and you shall be a part of that." "Bu... but... the line!  I'll never make it to the head of the queue. It all begins here, and I haven't a prayer of getting in." She leans down, her lobster red lips only inches from your own, and for a moment you find it difficult to breathe... but then you do breathe, and you think you can smell mango on her breath.  "Hush, handsome sorcerer," she says.  "You are in Boston.  Has not Boston been the site of many adversities?  When America desired freedom, was Boston not the site of so many events that led up to the historic break from Britain? When the people of Ireland suffered from famine, was it not Boston who took in the hungry, and filled them with hope and determination?"  Her gaze seems to penetrate into your very soul, and you are unable to speak.  "Yes," she continues, "And so too shall Boston be the site where the greater world rediscovered interactive fiction.
