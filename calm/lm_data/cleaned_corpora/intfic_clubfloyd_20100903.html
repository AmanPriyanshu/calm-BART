As your eyes begin to droop, Junior walks up to you, his steps tentative. "Father," he says, "please try to understand what is happening to you..." You start to protest -- do I look like your goddamn father, you imbecile? -- but stop short. All these resurrections, and the way the house is different every time you turn around... could you be inhabiting Whitman's body? You try to look at yourself, but you're just so damn tired... "This isn't about stealing my money," Junior says. You squint: suddenly there are two of them, then four. "This isn't about me at all," they say. "Or about Mother, or even Gregory. No, this is about Betsy. Betsy was the last..." Junior no doubt has a lengthy harangue memorized for this occasion, but his voice grows quiet in your ears and soon he is talking to himself. *** You have died *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, or QUIT?

[STATE] You nearly put your back out, but you manage to move the heavy rug enough to reveal a trap door. [ACTION] examine corpse [STATE] The corpse stirs as you approach. And that's when you realize: this isn't you, it's Whitman. And he's not even dead. Merely drunk. "...goddamn brats always making such a goddamn racket..." he mutters. You don't hear anything, but then, you rarely hear much of anything over the constant roar in your ears. But a moment later you see what he must be talking about, as the boys, Johnny and Gregory, come tearing into the front room, fighting as always -- this time it's not an exchange of blows but just a frantic wrestling match, over, what? A toy? Or are they just You're doubled over. The pain, god damn it the pain -- that kid smacked right into your leg, drove the shrapnel right through half a dozen nerves, like the whole limb was being blown open all over again... and you, you seem to have thrown him across the room, and he hit the wall... that's a load-bearing wall. His head is bleeding... must have hit a wall stud... A doctor, Johnny is crying. Gregory needs a doctor. A doctor, a doctor, Whitman whimpers. He is doubled up next to you and for a moment you are back in the forest with Union shells going off around you. Except they're not called doctors in wartime, they're called surgeons. And making noise and thrashing around just means you'll get a bayonet in the gut from some goddamn Yank. Oh god, my son, Whitman mewls, and you punch him in the face to shut him up. That gets Johnny's attention. Someone has to take control here, and though you can barely see from the pain, Whitman sure as hell isn't up to the task. So there will be no goddamn doctors. No one is to know about this. You, Johnny, are to take little Gregory down to the basement. If he dies, he dies. If he recovers, he recovers. If he ends up somewhere in between, well, Johnny, that's your responsibility. I'm not cleaning up after some idiot kid. Oh, now Whitman's picking himself up off the floor. See here, he's saying. This is my house, and you aren't going to-- Shut your goddamn mouth. This is my house. I built it. You just sat there. The same way you just sit there while your bastard children are running amok, have to keep calling me over anytime you need to establish a little discipline. That means I make the rules. Got it? Anyone else want to order me around? How about you? Well, to hell with you too. I don't care what you want. Nobody messes with Bill Blake, and nobody orders him around. Not snotnosed kids, not impotent cripples, not the nigger-loving Union government, not God the fucking Almighty. The Grim Reaper has no say over Bill Blake, and neither do you. If your commands and what he wants to do happen to coincide, well zip-a-dee-goddamn-doo-dah. And right now he's getting the hell out of here. Outside the house The dogs are back, still chewing on that corpse... but wait. If the corpse in the easy chair was actually Whitman, alive, then this one... need a closer look... But the dogs are gone. The dogs are gone, and the sun is bouncing around in the sky like a rubber ball. And... it was so clear a moment ago... had a plan in mind, but now... don't know what to do, where to go... don't even know who's asking the question... Help... please, help... [ACTION] examine me

Whitman is sitting next to her. His belt is undone and he is smeared with blood. "It wasn't me, it wasn't me," he is saying. "It was him!" He is pointing at you. You look down. You are also covered in blood. Inside the house You are standing in the front room of a white house. You know this because you are staring at yourself from across the room. He doesn't see you, though; he's looking at someone else. And though you can't see that person's face, it seems to be-- "Tycho Green," he says. "You may remember me from such wars as the American Civil War. I'm betting you've been wondering what's been happening to you. The question is, do you really want to know? It takes a while to drop the phat info-b0mbz, and chances are your scattered little nineteenth-century brane couldn't begin to comprehend the tale. But it's your call -- want the story? "Yes," says the man with your face. And then he vanishes. "Frag," Green mutters. Then he turns around and spots you. "Dammit, stop bi-locating," he says. "All right, here's the scoop. I am from what you would call the 22nd century. We'd call it something more like Window 2101-2200 Sphere 123488.59588 Track ZZ9, but then, reckoning of the date got vastly more complicated once time travel was invented. Little thingawhoozits about the size of a hockey puck -- have they invented hockey yet? is that 19th century or 20th? I always get those confused. Anyway, you key in your temporal coordinates, blip back to wherever you want to go. Only goes backwards, y'skate. Can't go forward because there's branching. Bifurcation? Try bajillionifurcation. At any moment there are something like seven point six times ten to your mom little subatomic blips that could blip some other way. It's like a tree -- you can follow any branch back to the trunk, no decision-making necessary. But finding the right branch from the trunk, well, you have to choose wisely. The hockey puck can't choose because the calculations would take quite literally forever and also it would melt and also it can't just pick at random because most combinations of subatomic blips lead to the universe spontaneously combusting without so much as a 'Bye bye, grandpa loves you.'" Behind the house You are standing east of a white house, surrounded by smaller buildings which are collapsing and building themselves back up before your eyes. A carriage wheezes out of the carriage house, then vanishes. Green emerges from the outhouse and taps you on the shoulder. "So most people don't bother blipping back in time," he continues, "because they can't get back. But me, I met this girlie and I decided that she would be mine. Except that she'd been dead for two hundred years and I didn't want to dig her up because, eww, gross. I'm talking about Ann Whitman here. Not too shabby, hmm? You've got your Homer, your Bill Shakespeare, your Ann Whitman and I guess now your Thu Minh Tran though, just between you and me, I think she's overrated. But Ann, now, her littachur just struck a chord with me. Me and eleven billion other people, key, but still. So I decided I'd review some tapes, learn your dialect, blip back, sweep her off her feet, the whole bit. Key, that means she'd never actually get around to writing her books, but no paradoxes here -- soon as you show up in the past and start changing stuff, you get bifurcated off the tree right away and can't hurt the original branch.
