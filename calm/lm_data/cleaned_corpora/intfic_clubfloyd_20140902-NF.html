[STATE]  Balcony Stairs There isn't really any room in here for anything except the stairs up to the balcony. An archway to the west leads back out into the sanctuary. Aiden mopes along after you. "Yeah, Orchid brought the idea to me. She said if she could write a story about a real ghost, then maybe people would actually read the newspaper. Heh. But I told her I'd help her." "Why?" "For the heck of it, primarily." [ACTION] down [STATE]  From here, you could head west to the sanctuary and up to the balcony. [ACTION] west

It certainly didn't look so huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews. Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony. It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and lifeless. Aiden follows you in. "Originally, she was just going to let me in the church during the sleepover, and we'd just spend the night taking a bunch of ghost pictures. However. Then we found out that you were going to be the other newspaper girl staying the night. And Orchid said you'd never go along with it. So we had to change the plan." [ACTION] north

A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags. To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is south of here, but that's none of your concern currently. Aiden follows you in. As you enter the narthex, Orchid strolls in through the front door of the church. When she sees Aiden, her eyes go wide. "Aiden! What are you doing here?" "Hey. Don't bother," Aiden snaps. "I've already told her everything. Or almost everything. Heh." Orchid rushes up to Aiden with her fists clenched. "You're lying. There's no proof. All you can prove is that you broke into the church and tried to scare us." "Well, no," says Aiden. "I can prove some other things. I have the receipts. For the makeup and everything. Because you had to use a credit card, idiot." Orchid goes quiet. "Well, we can talk about this in the morning," Aiden says, and he makes for the southern exit—but you grab his arm, and he cries out softly. "Yeah. Your way is probably better." [ACTION] east

The main stairway is north, the kitchen is east, and the narthex is west. One corner is given over to a glass case containing a model church. Aiden and Orchid come in after you. "Now, where were we? Orchid didn't trust you to help her pull off this hoax. She said you're too much of a straight arrow. Those weren't her exact words. What were your exact words, Orchid?"

There are doors to the north, northeast and southeast; according to the plaques on them, they open onto the pastor's office, the men's restroom and the ladies' restroom respectively. A vast framed poster is hanging on the wall in between the restroom doors, and in the middle of the room, directly facing the poster, is a wooden bench. Orchid and Aiden follow along. "But Orchid had this other great idea. She figured if we went a little further with the hoax, we could get you to believe the ghost was real. Heh." "I wasn't trying to trick you!" Orchid pleads. "I just wanted it to be authentic. I wanted it to be a great story." "Sure, and then the great ghost story would be in the newspaper with the name of the most trustworthy reporter on staff on it, and Orchid's name too." Aiden chuckles.
