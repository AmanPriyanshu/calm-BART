Frankie bumps into Cleopatra standing next to the stage, sending her to the floor and knocking the headdress from her head. He extends his hand down to her, but she swats it away and glowers. Black Widow, a woman dressed in black with a red hourglass symbol on her back, picks up the headdress. Cleopatra snatches it back, stands, and returns to her spot beside the stage. Frankie stops in front of you. Are those batteries attached to opposite sides of his neck?  you wonder. As Frankie speaks, his chin taps at the antenna protruding up from your forehead, and his breath suffocates your nose with alcohol. "Our whorey sister over there has sent me." He gestures erratically behind him. A nun with a hunched back bends over the punchbowl by the stage. You think he must have said "holy" sister, not "whorey." The nun straightens and turns around to face you. She rests her cup of punch on her pregnant belly. "She told me it's your turn in the Fly Eye, Goldie," Frankie says. Goldie? you wonder. My name isn't Goldie. Then you realize that, despite the alcoholic soup bathing his brain, Frankie connected your costume with the eponymous horror film, Goldie being a contraction of its star's surname, Goldblum. Frankie retreats toward Cleopatra. Arms crossed, she stands firm. Frankie stumbles away, passing Black Widow who, head cocked, watches Cleopatra.

Fiddling with the stereo, she says something and gestures for Rasputin to join her. Rasputin takes a deep breath, rubs his palms on his pants, and makes his way over to Black Widow. She points at a knot of cables snaking from the equipment to a dark corner behind some speakers. Rasputin hesitates then reaches into the darkness. Suddenly, he flings his arm back and stumbles backward. With wide eyes, he rubs his hand and speaks. Black Widow frowns and inspects Rasputin's hand. She shrugs.

Black Widow, a woman dressed in black with a red hourglass symbol on her back, picks up the headdress. Cleopatra snatches it back, stands, and returns to her spot beside the stage. Frankie stops in front of you. Are those batteries attached to opposite sides of his neck?  you wonder. As Frankie speaks, his chin taps at the antenna protruding up from your forehead, and his breath suffocates your nose with alcohol. "Our whorey sister over there has sent me." He gestures erratically behind him. A nun with a hunched back bends over the punchbowl by the stage. You think he must have said "holy" sister, not "whorey." The nun straightens and turns around to face you. She rests her cup of punch on her pregnant belly. "She told me it's your turn in the Fly Eye, Goldie," Frankie says. Goldie? you wonder. My name isn't Goldie. Then you realize that, despite the alcoholic soup bathing his brain, Frankie connected your costume with the eponymous horror film, Goldie being a contraction of its star's surname, Goldblum. Frankie retreats toward Cleopatra. Arms crossed, she stands firm. Frankie stumbles away, passing Black Widow who, head cocked, watches Cleopatra. You glance at the double doors and consider making your exit to the Fly Eye, but the nun attracts your attention. She smiles and raises her cup in salute. [ACTION] talk to nun

The wire frames of your wings bend as you gently lean back into the only chair in the room.

The five screens receive signals from cameras in five different rooms in the mansion. Normally, these would be used for security, but tonight the Society is trying to record footage of the supernatural that will raise the eyebrows of even the most stone-faced skeptics. While you're hoping to witness such phenomena, following the exploits of any one of the costumed characters would probably be more interesting, after looking at the screens to decide which captures your attention.

He drops the axe and begins to gather them up. Watching Rasputin, the medicine man retrieves his staff.

Rasputin watches the dolls as he speaks. "Wayne Harrison was having a birthday party for his twin daughters in this room. They had cake and drinks."   His voice lowers. "Most of the kids died.
