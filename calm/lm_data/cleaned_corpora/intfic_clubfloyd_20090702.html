[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. At last, your troubled fortunes seemed to come to an end. It all happened very quickly: the callback from Red Hat, the bizarre interview with Human Resources, the handshake, the filling out of W-2 forms, and then your first day of work. You thought maybe your experience writing Interactive Fiction games (sixteenth place in the last IF Comp, a good improvement from 33rd place the year before that) had finally landed you a programming job. But no, you seemed to qualify only for menial clerical work. You took it. What else could you do? Sigh. File Room This bleak room with its short, slumping ceiling does nothing to brighten your morale. Short file cabinets, marked in reverse alphabetical order, crawl in a line along the walls like an army of stupid robots. One measly window lets in a tiny square of sunlight.

There is a terrific crash and then a fast series of metallic whupping noises. Melvin comes limping in through the southeast wall, looking the worse for wear.

More than that, it is the archetypal dead end. Nowhere forward, nowhere back. The ceiling shocks with its height, the walls oppress with their closeness. There are no exits. Melvin will be here at any moment. "Do we know what to do?" Valerie asks Peter. "I hope so, or we're dead." Peter says. [ACTION] dig shovel
[STATE] You make it across the room, but just barely; just as you duck through the door, a huge hammer crashes down behind, missing by an inch. Something you stepped on along the way clicked as well, and with a horrible screeching noise, the machinery speeds up, crashing faster and faster until it's twice as fast as before. From behind, you hear Melvin cry, "Hey! No fair!" That machinery ought to slow him down for at least a minute or two. Dead End (as Peter and Valerie) It is the classic dead end. More than that, it is the archetypal dead end. Nowhere forward, nowhere back. The ceiling shocks with its height, the walls oppress with their closeness. There are no exits. Melvin will be here at any moment. "Do we know what to do?" Valerie asks Peter. "I hope so, or we're dead." Peter says. [ACTION] dig shovel [STATE] Peter attacks the soft ground with the shovel. It seems to magically bite large chunks at a time, like a ravenous rodent burrowing into angel food cake. The scooped material seems to vanish like evaporating bubbles, leaving only a deep pit behind. Unfortunately, Peter himself ends up at the bottom of it. [ACTION] peter, out

There is a terrific crash and then a fast series of metallic whupping noises. Melvin comes limping in through the southeast wall, looking the worse for wear. Several spears are skewered in his sides, and one leg drags limply behind him. "My ray gun got smashed by the hammer," he mopes."Hey, where's your boyfriend? You two get separated? Don't worry, you guys will have a touching reunion in Hell." With a steely 'snikt', long metal blades protrude out of his knuckles. [ACTION] inventory

Melvin looks like he's gotten the wind knocked out of him, if that's possible. Probably getting past the crashing machinery trap took more out of him than you guessed. He stands up woozily.

However, the magic is too powerful to be constrained. The more he reads, the clearer his pronunciation becomes, as the magic works through him. As he finishes the incantation, there is a noise like the rushing of open wind through a great tunnel. The secret door ripples and shimmers, trapped in a state between reality and mirage. Then, so suddenly that it is missed in a blink, the door is gone, leaving only a blank wall. There is no trace that it had ever been here. Zarf nods. "Now the other," he says. [ACTION] caskly

The room begins to melt; plaster, plastic, metal, and glass drip down like wax; loose papers lift and twirl in swelling eddies, spinning upwards from all directions. Then, familiar forms start reasserting themselves. Torn pages mend themselves out of the whirlwind, flowing back into place. Cabinet after cabinet slots itself into position, drawers agape, eating documents that file themselves. All is changed. The copier machine refuses its alien origins and becomes happily mudane, humming to life and churning out copies of a wonderfully boring document. "What just happened?" Valerie asks.
