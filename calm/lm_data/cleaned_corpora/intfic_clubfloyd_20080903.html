[pausing to show unread error message] THE QUEEN OF SWORDS [Please press SPACE to begin.] Each week, you spend four hours round-trip in a car to take a beginner's fencing class at the Virginia Academy of Fencing in Springfield. It's fun, you tell yourself, and it never hurts to be more active. David, on the other hand, wants to compete. Your husband wants to join the U.S. Fencing Association and begin competing in regional tournaments after only eight weeks of classes, when they tell people to take lessons for a whole year before competing. However, David will want what David will want, and you love your husband dearly, so... There's a tournament in Glen Falls this weekend, and you're going. On your last trip to VAF you spent over $900 on electric fencing equipment. The real problem is going to figure out how to use all of it: what plugs into where, which piece you need to put on first, and how to fence with a floor cord holding you back. That's why you and David are going to use tonight, while you have the room at the local library reserved, to practice gearing up for electric. David gets a good parking spot downtown, and the two of you haul the bags of equipment out of the trunk and into the library. The librarians wave at you as you pass, already used to seeing you, and the two of you make your way to one of the larger meeting rooms upstairs to set up the electric strip. David drops his equipment bag near the door and smiles at you. "I'll put the strip up," he says. "Why don't you go ahead and get your stuff on?" You look at your bag uncertainly. "I'm not sure I know where everything goes," you say. He grins. "Me neither," he says. "If you have trouble, let me know, and I'll try to help."

[ACTION] yes [STATE] THE QUEEN OF SWORDS [Please press SPACE to begin.] Each week, you spend four hours round-trip in a car to take a beginner's fencing class at the Virginia Academy of Fencing in Springfield. It's fun, you tell yourself, and it never hurts to be more active. David, on the other hand, wants to compete. Your husband wants to join the U.S. Fencing Association and begin competing in regional tournaments after only eight weeks of classes, when they tell people to take lessons for a whole year before competing. However, David will want what David will want, and you love your husband dearly, so... There's a tournament in Glen Falls this weekend, and you're going. On your last trip to VAF you spent over $900 on electric fencing equipment. The real problem is going to figure out how to use all of it: what plugs into where, which piece you need to put on first, and how to fence with a floor cord holding you back. That's why you and David are going to use tonight, while you have the room at the local library reserved, to practice gearing up for electric. David gets a good parking spot downtown, and the two of you haul the bags of equipment out of the trunk and into the library. The librarians wave at you as you pass, already used to seeing you, and the two of you make your way to one of the larger meeting rooms upstairs to set up the electric strip. David drops his equipment bag near the door and smiles at you. "I'll put the strip up," he says. "Why don't you go ahead and get your stuff on?" You look at your bag uncertainly. "I'm not sure I know where everything goes," you say. He grins. "Me neither," he says. "If you have trouble, let me know, and I'll try to help." He takes the bag with the scoring box and floor reels and goes to set up a table. You survey the room.

Of course, tonight it's just you and David. A row of tall windows line the western wall, and stacks of chairs are at either end of the long north-south room. The door to the hallway is east. An industrial-type carpet in garish red covers the floor. The open windows let in a welcome breeze. [ACTION] drop bag [STATE] You set the bag down, out of the way against a wall. David pushes the table against the eastern wall. [ACTION] open it
[STATE] You set the bag down, out of the way against a wall. David pushes the table against the eastern wall. [ACTION] open it [STATE] You open the fencing bag, revealing a mask, a jacket, a body cord, an electric foil, a lam?, a glove, a plastron and a chest protector.

[STATE] You put on the plastron. David takes a floor reel and floor cord from the bag. [ACTION] take lame [STATE] Taken. He walks to the north end of the room and sets down the floor reel. [ACTION] examine lame
[STATE] Taken. He walks to the north end of the room and sets down the floor reel. [ACTION] examine lame [STATE] The lam? (pronounced "luh-MAY") is like a sleeveless, metal vest, used in electric foil fencing to define your target area--literally, since the opponent's blade must strike you on the lam? to complete the correct circuit. It The lam? is made to cover your torso from neck to waistline, with an additional section in front best described by drawing a line from your hips to your pelvis. Yours is an Uhlmann lam?, quite high quality, although it cost a good deal. There is a small, metal D-ring (shaped like the letter D) sewn into the back of the lam?. David plugs the floor cord into the floor reel. [ACTION] take body cord

[STATE] You unzip the jacket. David takes the other floor cord out of the bag and plugs one end into the box. [ACTION] examine jacket [STATE] Your jacket covers your torso and arms while you fence. They are required to be white, and yours zips up the front (making it much easier to put on by yourself). Although the FIE requires 800 Newton resistance, you are merely fencing in the USFA, which has much more lax requirements than its European counterpart, so yours is only rated at 350 Newtons. David takes the other reel from the bag. [ACTION] attach body cord to jacket

Setting the floor reel on the carpet, David plugs the free end of the floor cord into it. [ACTION] examine body cord [STATE] Your body cord is used in electric fencing to connect several different circuits of electricity. On one end, the two-prong connector attaches to your electric foil. The other end has an alligator clip, to hook to your lam?, and a three-prong connector, to plug into the floor reel. In between is about five feet of insulated wiring, which is supposed to run up your sleeve and down your back. David turns to survey his work. [ACTION] put body cord in sleeve

The snowstorm draws thicker and the faint grey silhouette of the reconnaissance plane fades away completely.  You bank hard, yanking on the control column with mild panic, but it's too late.  Your paths have diverged, unlikely to cross again as long as this lethal weather continues. The lumbering two-seater plane you were supposed to be escorting is alone and unprotected.  And she is out there: lightning fast, deadly accurate and cold as ice.  You'd consider turning back to the airbase right away. If, that is, you even knew where you were.

[STATE] Your Swordfish's trusty joystick features a tempting red button on the top.  Pushing or pulling the column will adjust your pitch. You suppress a shiver. [ACTION] push column [STATE] You grip the control column tightly and push it forward, hoping to sink within sight of the ground. Almost before you can react, a huge shape swoops out of the white void below: a scarlet triplane, close enough that you can see its pilot, and the surprised expression on her face.  You pull on the control column hard and punch the throttle, feeling your plane strain to rise higher. For an instant you think you've avoided disaster. And then the whole fuselage lurches, the sound of metal on metal scraping right into your brain as you collide glancingly with the other plane.  You look over your shoulder just in time to see the scarlet triplane disappear into the clouds, trailing thick black smoke. Turning back to your controls you immediately notice the epileptic motion of the rapidly spinning altimeter. It would seem that you have a problem. (Your score has just increased by one point.)

[ACTION] stand [STATE] You check your parachute and climb up onto your seat.  After you throw your leg over the side, it's surprisingly easy to push yourself away from the plane and leap into the mist. Not quite as aerodynamic as your Swordfish, you drop like a stone, plummeting into the murky white void below.  Ice and fog crowd close around you, obscuring every direction.  The only reason you know you're falling is because of the way your stomach seems to still be a hundred metres above you somewhere.  Remembering the single parachute jump you performed in basic training, you fumble with the chord and yank hard, the harness suddenly seeming to pull you upwards. Falling You're hanging from a parachute, descending slowly into a blank white void.  Without the sound of your plane's engine, everything seems shockingly silent.

Unless you can think of a way an all-male group might have gained extra practice in that regard?" "Clearly you don't have enough confidence in your abilities to just get on with it." "I'm just trying to get you to save your energy." You both tend to the sticks in intense silence from then on.  But the fire doesn't suddenly spark to life, it forms slowly from a wisp of smoke, and it's hard to tell which of you is more responsible for it.

The night is cold, and the two of you cling to one another for warmth, but the snow has finally stopped falling and the fire burns until morning. Then the two of you struggle to your feet, Imelda just contending with aches and cramps while you have to worry about your broken leg. Looking around at the pristine forest, everything covered in thick sheets of snow, you begin to make your way north, Imelda encouraging you to lean on her as much as you can.  Eventually, the bright scarlet wingtip of her triplane has disappeared from view. Not long after that... You sit by the window, looking down on the clouds, feeling the throbbing of the zeppelin's engine.  The door opens and Imelda enters. "Is this a conjugal visit?" you ask her. She looks puzzled.  "Have I ever made any other kind of visit?" She walks across your improbably luxurious cabin - not that you're allowed to leave it - and sits on the window sill next to you. "Are you okay?" she asks.  "I thought they'd be a little more lenient with you, but it seems you're going to be in here til the war ends." You shrug.  "The view's nice.  The company's great.  I've caught up on my reading." "Wouldn't you be more comfortable lying on the bed?" she asks. You look at her with mock naivety.  "Why do you ask?" Years later... Imelda rolls off of you and sparks up a cigarette, the sheets around her hips.  You study her silhouette in the twilight. "The air race tomorrow," she says. "Everyone will be there," you say proudly.  "Everyone wants to see the world's most famous aces competing against one another." She takes a deep drag and lets the smoke curl slowly from her lips before speaking.  "I just want to make sure you know I won't hold back, just because it's you." You laugh.  "You're not going to get a chance to.  You'll have to be flat out just to be able to spot me on the horizon." She holds out her hand and you take it.  "May the best woman win," she says. "May she come second, after me," you counter. There's a moment's pause.  The quiet sounds of evening drift in through an open window. "Lucas..."  Imelda takes a deep breath.  "There's something I need to ask you.  After the race, what... what's going to happen?" "Easy," you say.  "I go where you go.  As always." She smiles.  "That's going to be difficult.  I'll be going where you're going.  We'll be chasing one another in circles." "Like dogfighting all over again." She kisses the corner of your mouth.  "I love you." You kiss her back, passionately.  "I love you too." Many years later... The champagne cork pops explosively and you both jump. "Careful," Imelda says, "you'll have someone's eye out." You pour out two glasses.  "Yes, you have to be careful in that regard." "Thank you," Imelda says, taking a glass and bringing it to her lips. "Hold on, we haven't had a toast yet." "That's easy," she says, raising her glass.  "To us.  And another twenty years of fucking, flying and friendship." "To the three 'F's," you agree, tapping your glass against hers. "The three 'F's." You take a deep breath of mountain air.  The precarious buildings of Aerocity surround you, glistening with frost.  "It's quite a view," you say, looking across the world from up high. "As good as flying," Imelda says.  "Almost as good as love." You lean together and kiss, the setting sun glinting on snow-topped mountains. *** THE END *** In 111 moves, you have scored 7 of a possible 7 points.

[STATE] You let your head rest on Imelda's shoulder, and sleep descends like a dark blanket. The night is cold, and the two of you cling to one another for warmth, but the snow has finally stopped falling and the fire burns until morning. Then the two of you struggle to your feet, Imelda just contending with aches and cramps while you have to worry about your broken leg. Looking around at the pristine forest, everything covered in thick sheets of snow, you begin to make your way north, Imelda encouraging you to lean on her as much as you can.  Eventually, the bright scarlet wingtip of her triplane has disappeared from view. Not long after that... You sit by the window, looking down on the clouds, feeling the throbbing of the zeppelin's engine.  The door opens and Imelda enters. "Is this a conjugal visit?" you ask her. She looks puzzled.  "Have I ever made any other kind of visit?" She walks across your improbably luxurious cabin - not that you're allowed to leave it - and sits on the window sill next to you. "Are you okay?" she asks.  "I thought they'd be a little more lenient with you, but it seems you're going to be in here til the war ends." You shrug.  "The view's nice.  The company's great.  I've caught up on my reading." "Wouldn't you be more comfortable lying on the bed?" she asks. You look at her with mock naivety.  "Why do you ask?" Years later... Imelda rolls off of you and sparks up a cigarette, the sheets around her hips.  You study her silhouette in the twilight. "The air race tomorrow," she says.

[STATE] "I think you should come south with me," you say.  "The Benevolent Empire always treats its prisoners well, and I have plenty of clout. We'd be able to spend quite a bit of time together."

"I think we could build a fire.  If we put it right there it should be close enough to warm us up, but the wind will blow the smoke away from us." Imelda crawls out from under the wing and stands up, snow crunching beneath her feet.  "Okay, I'll go find some wood, or anything else that looks like it'll burn.  Give me your gun.  I'd hate to have to face down a feral icekin with nothing but a couple of pine branches." (You could agree, or politely refuse.) [ACTION] refuse

You go to say more, but she turns around and scampers off, her footsteps crunching in the snow. Time passes slowly while Imelda is gone.  You feel yourself growing sleepy, and the feeling leaves your hands and feet.  Only the dull pain in your broken leg keeps you awake. You snap back to reality as something approaches, trudging quickly through the frost.  Before you have time to consider what to do if it turns out to be a dangerous creature, Imelda appears in front of you and dumps an armful of branches and sticks into the snow. "Gods it's cold," she announces, throwing herself onto all fours and crawling back under the wing.  She curls up right next to you, shivering, and you obligingly wrap your arms around her to help warm her up.  Not entirely a selfless act, as you're pretty cold yourself. "Okay," Imelda says after a while.  "Got to try and turn this ugly heap of sticks into a nice fire..." You rub your hands together to try to keep them warm.

[ACTION] tell her you can do better [STATE] You shift your broken leg so that you can grab a couple of sticks from the pile.  "I think the Boy Scouts need to take over here," you tell Imelda. She gives you a very doubtful look.  "Excuse me?  The Sky Guides are more than capable of rubbing two sticks together.  Unless you can think of a way an all-male group might have gained extra practice in that regard?" "Clearly you don't have enough confidence in your abilities to just get on with it." "I'm just trying to get you to save your energy." You both tend to the sticks in intense silence from then on.  But the fire doesn't suddenly spark to life, it forms slowly from a wisp of smoke, and it's hard to tell which of you is more responsible for it. When it's crackling away nicely, you both sit back, shoulder-to-shoulder. "I told you to save your energy," Imelda says.  "That was clearly my spark that lit it." You shake your head.  "My sparks were much more vibrant.  You could tell they had the Lucas Thane never-give-up attitude." "Fine, keep lying to yourself.  We both know the truth." "I agree that one of us is in denial, but I don't think it's me." Imelda holds out her hands to the fire.  "It's nice that we got it done, though." You hold out your own hands.

We're young, we're forced to deal with one another repeatedly in intense, passionate, but graceful and playful circumstances, we understand the stresses, the fears we each experience, we both love flying... and so we grow attracted to one another." The two of you lean closer as she speaks, your lips brushing together. "My lips are numb," you complain. She shushes you.  "Let me warm them up."

[STATE] The story doesn't understand that command. [ACTION] sleep [STATE] You let your head rest on Imelda's shoulder, and sleep descends like a dark blanket. The night is cold, and the two of you cling to one another for warmth, but the snow has finally stopped falling and the fire burns until morning. Then the two of you struggle to your feet, Imelda just contending with aches and cramps while you have to worry about your broken leg. Looking around at the pristine forest, everything covered in thick sheets of snow, you begin to make your way south, Imelda encouraging you to lean on her as much as you can.  Eventually, the bright scarlet wingtip of her triplane has disappeared from view. Not long after that... The guard shoots you a black look, but you show him your authorisation and he unlocks the door.  Inside, Imelda sits at a table, looking thoroughly bored. "Lucas," she sighs.  "Things are looking up." "I'm really sorry for this," you tell her.  "It seems the intelligence services can do what they want and there's nothing we can do about it. They treated you well, at least?" "They accepted it when I refused to answer their questions, yes.  The northern ace of aces is out of action, if they beat me up, their own ace of aces will probably follow suit.  I don't think they're really that interested in getting information out of me, to be honest.  It seemed like a formality.  A boring, boring formality." You take a deep breath and then say, "They're prepared to put you under house arrest in a nice little town not too far south of here." "And how often will I see you?" "As often as I can make the journey." "Will you..."  She clears her throat.  "Will you be able to stay the night?" "If I bribe the right guard, I should think so." She grins carnivorously.  "Well, that's the important thing." "I'm sorry for this." She smiles.  "It's okay, I know it's not your fault." Years later... Imelda rolls off of you and sparks up a cigarette, the sheets around her hips.  You study her silhouette in the twilight. "The air race tomorrow," she says. "Everyone will be there," you say proudly.  "Everyone wants to see the world's most famous aces competing against one another." She takes a deep drag and lets the smoke curl slowly from her lips before speaking.  "I don't like the way you take so many risks to try and beat me.  You could die." You laugh.  "You just want to make sure you win." She shoots you a fierce look.  "I'm not joking." "Okay, I know, Mel, I know." You rest your hand reassuringly on her leg.  "Maybe we should pack in the daredevil flying anyway.  It's for the young and carefree, people with nothing to lose.  Whereas we're..." She places her hand on top of yours."We have one another." You nod.  "But still, the race tomorrow..." Imelda laughs.  "You're going to do great," she says.  "You'll be finishing second.  Right after me." "We'll see." There's a moment's pause.  The quiet sounds of evening drift in through an open window. "Lucas..."  Imelda takes a deep breath.  "There's something I need to ask you.  After the race, what... what's going to happen?" "I..."  You shake your head. She looks at you sadly.  "Yeah, you never did let that barrier drop.  I guess it's too much to imagine that people who've tried to kill one another could ever end up being too close." "I will miss you," you tell her. She kisses the corner of your mouth. You slip your arm around her and kiss her back. Many years later... "Oh my god, Lucas Thane it is you" You spin around and find yourself facing a strangely familiar redheaded woman.  "Imelda?  Is that you?  You look so different!" She touches her fingers to her cheeks.  "It's the glass eye.  No-one from back then recognises me anymore." "That's terrible," you say, "I thought the eye patch really suited you." "Well, it doesn't help much to look like a pirate when you're designing planes." "Monoplanes, eh?  Who'd have thought it?" "I know!  Look, you've got to come round some time, reminisce about old times." "Sounds like a plan." "Are you still the dashing bachelor of legend?" You look thoughtfully at the sky.  "Oh, you know how it is.  You meet a lot of people, but they never match up to the one that got away." She looks at you thoughfully.  "You're a stupid bastard, Lucas Thane," she says softly. You just stare at her. She points a thumb over her shoulder.  "My place is this way.  Come on." Uncertain what to expect, you take her hand. *** THE END *** In 88 moves, you have scored 5 of a possible 7 points.  This makes you a group captain.
