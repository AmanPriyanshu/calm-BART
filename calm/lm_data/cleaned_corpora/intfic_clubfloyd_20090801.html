The drums of war have beaten long throughout the land of your forefathers.  At night, the fiendish glow of enemy campfires has shone orange and horrible on the horizon for as many years as you can recall. The warriors of your land have battled long and valiantly against the demon hordes pressing relentlessly forward, assailing your ever-diminishing borders.  The fight has been mighty, but the strength of your people has begun to wane.  Only a few of the warriors remain to lead the rag-tag brigades of youthful peasants into battle. The council of elders has seen that it is not long before the invaders will breach the skirmish lines and plunder the farms and villages of your homeland.  The council has decreed that after centuries of silence, the voice of the great oracle must be heard once more if this horrible foe is to be repelled. Barely old enough to follow the warriors into battle, you were filled with great pride when you were selected as the messenger who would be sent to beg the great oracle for her counsel.

The force of the current grows stronger and stronger until it sweeps you helplessly along.  In the darkness you scrape against the uneven stone walls and are pounded mercilessly into submerged boulders.  Your lungs burn with the desire for breath, but the cold water refuses to release you from its icy grip.  Consciousness begins to slip away from you.  The roaring, black water and jagged stones are fading into warm, gray oblivion... You are slammed back into wakefulness when your body is hurled over the precipice of a subterranean waterfall and spilled into an underground river flowing swiftly beneath the great mountain.  The river's dark channel is not completely submerged, and your head breaks the surface. Frantically, you draw in gasping lungfuls of air. After being swept along for some distance, the river's course turns suddenly.  You are pushed over a cluster of submerged stones near the rocky bank.  The great sword at your side somehow catches between the stones, stopping you dead in the raging current.  Fighting against the power of the river, you grasp hold of the slippery stones and work yourself free.  You scrabble along toward the river's edge and finally haul yourself out of the freezing water.  You find yourself in another great, subterranean chamber.

[ACTION] put amulet in hole [STATE] The amulet falls into the depths of the well, illuminating its stone sides as it plummets downward.  Eventually, the amulet's glow dwindles to a tiny pinpoint and finally, it winks out entirely.  You find yourself in total darkness. The blackness seems to close in upon you, choking the breath from your lungs.  Your heart hammers wildly in your chest.  The fear of dying, cold and alone deep in the bowels of the earth, suddenly grips you and holds you in its icy claws. An intensely bright beam of brilliant, white light suddenly blasts upward from within the well, and reflects off the mirror's polished surface.  The reflected beam of light illuminates the diagram of the lesser bruin etched on the floor, midway between the well and the northern wall. The blinding light slowly begins to change.  It becomes a softer, blue color, streaked here and there with rays of gold and red.  The beam of light illuminates the haze of sweet-smelling smoke that has drifted into the chamber from the north.  The billowing smoke seems to gather in upon itself, as though it were attracted to the beautiful light by some unseen force.  The smoke begins to swirl and churn within the beam of light, casting weird, sinuous shadows about the room.  It coalesces further into a tiny thunderstorm of brilliant color and flashing light. You notice a low, humming sound that fills the chamber, echoing wildly off the dark stone walls.  The humming becomes a loud whirring as the iridescent colors flash faster and faster.  The whirring increases to a near deafening roar.  The cloud of smoke thrums and pulses with blinding bursts of intensely colored light.  You clap your hands over your ears, attempting vainly to shut out the thunderous din, but it is of no use.  The tumult of sound and explosion of light seem ready to rend the very stone walls with their fury. With an incredibly powerful thump that vibrates you to the bone, all falls silent and the maelstrom of light calms to a steady glow.  Within the cloud of smoke, a beautiful, feminine face appears.  You draw in a sharp breath as you finally behold the oracle. It is a face of delicate beauty and timeless wisdom.  It is a face that has seen the birth of the world, and bears the weighty knowledge of the hour of its death.  The oracle regards you contemplatively for a moment. "You have travelled far to see me," her silken voice rolls forth like a wave crashing on some distant shore.  It is a voice of wonder, of horror.  It is the voice of dreams fulfilled. "I have watched the plight of your people, I know the great peril that lies before them..."  Her voice trails away like the falling of autumn leaves. "I have not the power to deliver your people from this plight."  She says with an expression of pensive sorrow.  "A new age is opening in the world, and the age past must fade away; along with it, my power in the world fades as well.  Already, you have seen the signs of this changing.  Mankind no longer seeks out the wisdom of the great ones. He has learned for himself the secrets of magic and science.  Flames at the altars to the gods burn no longer.  The gifts which the immortals once bestowed upon man, he will now obtain for himself.  Our time has come to a close." A wooden staff appears on the floor before the oracle.  "Take this," she says softly, her voice beginning to fade, "I cannot deliver your homeland, but with this gift you can set yourselves free." The wondrous face hangs in the air for a long moment, the features growing less distinct as the cloud of smoke gradually diffuses.  The beam of light dwindles away and finally disappears completely. With a lumbering, scraping sound a doorway opens in the southern wall and a flood of sunlight pours into the chamber. [Your score has increased.] [ACTION] get staff

[ACTION] raise gate [STATE] You raise the gate along its track and water spills into the sluice, filling the waterwheel's scoops.  After a moment, the force of the flowing water builds, and with a low, groaning creak, the great wheel begins to turn.  The iron chain is wound, clanking and scraping, onto the axle by the waterwheel's rotation.  The chain draws tight and the waterwheel's speed slows considerably. The wheel continues to turn however, drawing more chain down from some hidden place in the ceiling. The great chain is gradually wound around the great oaken axle as though it were a giant spool of thread.  A loud, grinding sound echoes from the southern end of the hall.  Finally, the chain stops feeding down from the ceiling and the wheel creaks to a halt.  The water in the sluice splashes noisily past the motionless wheel. [ACTION] put sword under gate

A faint haze of scented smoke billows in through the archway, filling the chamber with a sweet odor.  A polished, copper mirror, easily as tall as yourself, stands atop a massive stone dais near the center of the room.  The dais seems to have slid further back into the chamber, revealing a large, open well where the massive stone structure had been.  Stylized diagrams of what appear to be constellations have been carved into the chamber's floor and walls.  They form a line extending from the center of the well's northern edge, across the floor, and up to the top of the chamber's northern wall.  The mirror is mounted at its middle so that its reflective surface can tilt forward or back. Presently, the mirror is angled toward the lesser bruin etched on the floor, midway between the well and the northern wall. [ACTION] put amulet in well

Presently, the mirror is angled toward the lesser bruin etched on the floor, midway between the well and the northern wall. [ACTION] put amulet in well [STATE] The amulet falls into the depths of the well, illuminating its stone sides as it plummets downward.  Eventually, the amulet's glow dwindles to a tiny pinpoint and finally, it winks out entirely.  You find yourself in total darkness. The blackness seems to close in upon you, choking the breath from your lungs.  Your heart hammers wildly in your chest.  The fear of dying, cold and alone deep in the bowels of the earth, suddenly grips you and holds you in its icy claws. An intensely bright beam of brilliant, white light suddenly blasts upward from within the well, and reflects off the mirror's polished surface.  The reflected beam of light illuminates the diagram of the lesser bruin etched on the floor, midway between the well and the northern wall. The blinding light slowly begins to change.  It becomes a softer, blue color, streaked here and there with rays of gold and red.  The beam of light illuminates the haze of sweet-smelling smoke that has drifted into the chamber from the north.  The billowing smoke seems to gather in upon itself, as though it were attracted to the beautiful light by some unseen force.  The smoke begins to swirl and churn within the beam of light, casting weird, sinuous shadows about the room.  It coalesces further into a tiny thunderstorm of brilliant color and flashing light. You notice a low, humming sound that fills the chamber, echoing wildly off the dark stone walls.  The humming becomes a loud whirring as the iridescent colors flash faster and faster.  The whirring increases to a near deafening roar.  The cloud of smoke thrums and pulses with blinding bursts of intensely colored light.  You clap your hands over your ears, attempting vainly to shut out the thunderous din, but it is of no use.  The tumult of sound and explosion of light seem ready to rend the very stone walls with their fury. With an incredibly powerful thump that vibrates you to the bone, all falls silent and the maelstrom of light calms to a steady glow.  Within the cloud of smoke, a beautiful, feminine face appears.  You draw in a sharp breath as you finally behold the oracle. It is a face of delicate beauty and timeless wisdom.  It is a face that has seen the birth of the world, and bears the weighty knowledge of the hour of its death.  The oracle regards you contemplatively for a moment. "You have travelled far to see me," her silken voice rolls forth like a wave crashing on some distant shore.  It is a voice of wonder, of horror.  It is the voice of dreams fulfilled. "I have watched the plight of your people, I know the great peril that lies before them..."  Her voice trails away like the falling of autumn leaves. "I have not the power to deliver your people from this plight."  She says with an expression of pensive sorrow.  "A new age is opening in the world, and the age past must fade away; along with it, my power in the world fades as well.  Already, you have seen the signs of this changing.  Mankind no longer seeks out the wisdom of the great ones. He has learned for himself the secrets of magic and science.  Flames at the altars to the gods burn no longer.  The gifts which the immortals once bestowed upon man, he will now obtain for himself.  Our time has come to a close." A wooden staff appears on the floor before the oracle.  "Take this," she says softly, her voice beginning to fade, "I cannot deliver your homeland, but with this gift you can set yourselves free." The wondrous face hangs in the air for a long moment, the features growing less distinct as the cloud of smoke gradually diffuses.  The beam of light dwindles away and finally disappears completely. With a lumbering, scraping sound a doorway opens in the southern wall and a flood of sunlight pours into the chamber. [Your score has increased.] [ACTION] south
