[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Today is October 31st, 1987. Your friends have invited you to join them for a night of camping and partying. The campsite is around a two hour drive from where you live now. You aren't sure who the property belongs to, but it's not far from where Fred Murks' grandmother lived. You, Fred, and another friend of yours named Steve Dirks had made the site as kids before she died a couple of years later from pneumonia. You haven't been back since then. It was at least a cool place to go when you were too young to be smoking cigarettes because no one ever bothered you out there. Your friends are bringing the camping equipment, food, and beer. It should be a fun night. Supposedly some girls were going to be showing up as well, but we'll see about that. You come around one last tight curve and see Fred's car parked on the side of the road. It's probably safe to assume that they have already gathered their stuff and went to set up camp. You park nearby, and then feel the chilly air of the Fall afternoon as you step out of your car and lock the door...

Waterfall Room The area is covered in multiple smooth stalactites, stalagmites and flowstone. Shades of green and yellow shine on the walls of the cave in the white light of your battery-powered lantern. The sound of running water is much louder here. While there is no actual waterfall present in this deeper part of the cave, one wall of the room resembles a beautiful, cascading waterfall.

You can faintly make out a small opening in the pile above the surface of the water. There is a crumbling concrete wall on the south side of the room.
