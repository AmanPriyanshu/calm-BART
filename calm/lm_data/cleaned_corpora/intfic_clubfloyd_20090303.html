[STATE] As you pass the kennel, the dog bounds out and - his chain pulled taut - begins to bark loudly. The door to the farmhouse swings open, the farmer emerging onto the driveway. Seeing you and the dog, he pads across and grabs you by the neck, pulling you back before leading you gently to the goat shed. The rope on the door is tied tightly, and the farmer walks away. After maybe ten minutes, there is the sound of another vehicle turning up - ten minutes after that, the door is pulled open and half a dozen DEFRA slaughtermen burst in with bolt-guns. *** Your adventure is over *** In that game you scored 3 out of a possible 6, in 96 turns.
