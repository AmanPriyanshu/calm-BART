[STATE] You stride into the main hall, where fifteen of Dr. Sinister's finest await you. That's well past your comfort zone, but they're not looking like they're really in fighting trim. However, they're still numerous enough that you cannot battle your way through to the central bridge access ladder they guard. You make a careful retreat before the situation gets any worse. They do not follow. That's good for your prospects of survival, at least in the short term, but not so great for your long-term prospects of success. You've weakened their forces some, but it looks like you'll need to either weaken them some more or strengthen yourself to actually break through.

[You are flying.] [ACTION] out [STATE] You flutter through into the main hall, where fifteen of Dr. Sinister's finest await you. That's normally just a tad more than you're comfortable facing alone, but they were expecting someone coming in on the ground. More fool they. While you'd perhaps hoped to just fly over all of them, the spun gravity sends you careening about the room like a pinball, whacking and bowling over most of the men hoping to ambush you. Before the ones left conscious can regroup, you tilt your flight path to the central bridge's access ladder. Please press SPACE to continue. [ACTION] press space

[STATE] There is no real need for a cathartic scream at the moment. Your energy fails you, and your old nemesis gravity reasserts his dominance. [You are 25 feet and falling.] [ACTION] again [STATE] Well, nothing else to do at this point.  "AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA--" Several hundred movies and comic books to the contrary, water makes a terrible cushion for crash landings. Falling that far without a recharge, it's only slightly less resilient than concrete, really. Well, at least that means you don't have to worry about drowning. *** You are a shooting star *** In that game you scored 2 out of a possible 50, in 24 turns, earning you the rank of Wild Talent. You seem to have had a flight mishap. These are rather severe; a single UNDO is unlikely to put you in a position where you can continue. Two, however, should usually suffice for a safe landing, and three should guarantee you a survivable option in even the most extreme of circumstances. Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move, see the FULL score for that game, or QUIT? [ACTION] drop drink

Hangar Catwalk You're standing on a narrow catwalk ringing a vast hangar. To the west is an airlock leading into a bright yellow rocket that fills most of the area.

You could also easily take off from here, if you were so inclined. A small round access hatch stands open on the ceiling, leading up and out of the tower. Right then. Time to get to work.
