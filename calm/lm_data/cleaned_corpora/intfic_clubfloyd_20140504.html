[STATE]  Deep in the bowels of Io The silence is eerie. Passages lead north and east. [ACTION] north [STATE]  You head down the passage and emerge into a huge open chamber. Suddenly, hidden generators whine and the room is flooded with light again, illuminating the figure of Commander Brutus towering above you. "An intruder!" he cackles. "But how very perfectly timed! You shall be the first to witness my great triumph! Revel in this honour, for not much life remains to you in which to do so!" Brutus paces around in a circle atop the dais. "They never suspected, the fools! They thought that since I was the youngest, I was expendable! They sent me into the aluminium mines to die with all the commoners, to show that the great Chihuahua family was not above the humble day-to-day life-and-death struggle of the common miner. They thought they would never see me again! But HOW WRONG THEY WERE!" Brutus pauses. One thing is explained at least; the aluminium fumes have evidently destroyed his brain. He draws himself up for another tirade. "They thought I was the cruel ruler!" he sneers. "They thought I was just out for money! They never suspected that one day I would RULE THE UNIVERSE! I, with the aid of my terrible army of robot croutons, shall rise up and crush all the puny ants who oppose me beneath my aluminium toecaps!" As Brutus falls silent, you sense movement, and look down to see the tide of croutonic metal figures advancing upon you. Brutus leaps down from the dais and is lost among their number. The croutons swarm towards you. [ACTION] examine croutons
