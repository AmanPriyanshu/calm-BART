There are a lot of notes in the logbook's margins. Several of them are notes Quintin wrote when he made on-the-fly repairs to the station. One talks about the problems he'd had with the escape pod door malfunctioning, and how he had to disconnect the door control and computer from backup power to fix the problem. He noted that disconnecting only the green and yellow wires and connecting the two current-carrying wires?the white-and-red wire and the red wire?together would restore backup power. Normally the white-and-red wire and the red wire would run to the power source. [ACTION] aft
