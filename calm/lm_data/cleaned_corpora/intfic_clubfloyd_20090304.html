[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. "We'll have to split up. I'll go after the bombers, you find the fastest way out of here. Tell the President he has to evacuate, immediately!" Those were the last words you heard from Captain McBrawn before he rode away hanging on the skid of a helicopter with one hand, his muscular arm gleaming in the light of the setting sun. It is up to you now to find your way to the President of the World and warn him of the impending attack. Finally, some responsibility after all these years! You descend from the rooftop planning the trip to the drop-off point. At the base of the building the Screaming Communists capture you. Figures. Please press SPACE to continue. A group of stern, vicious looking Screaming Communists march through the barren land, dragging you behind them. Their destination is a gloomy medieval castle. The commander shouts orders to one of the soldiers who grabs you by the collar of your sweater and escorts you inside. After a long climb through dark corridors and endless staircases the guard throws you in a dark, cold cell and slams the door shut. A chill runs down your spine and desperation starts to creep in. Escapade!  This game is free software. Type LICENSE for details. The moonlight gives dim illumination to the front part of the cell, leaving the opposite wall completely in the dark. There's an unlit light bulb hanging from the ceiling and a heavy steel door on the wall opposite to the barred window, but the room is otherwise featureless. You can barely make out the outlines of some dark shapes in one dark corner of the cell. (For more information about the game, type ABOUT.) [ACTION] examine me

Eventually, arms aching and throat sore, you stagger offstage as the narrator delivers the closing speech. *** You have won *** Rating: ***** "A tour de force; a definitive performance.
