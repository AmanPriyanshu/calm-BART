There is a post-it note on the Medusa that says "CODE: WOW". This must be the access code Dr. Ng promised you. [ACTION] wow

[STATE]  The ring gets scuffed and dinged. The diamond falls out of the setting, but not much else happens. Diamonds are forever, Dr. Law. Ginger takes the transformed diamond ring and places it in a large box. Ginger sighs, and types, "I'm sorry, Fred, I can't figure out! Looks like you win this round. "I guess we'll need to start over." Ginger says, "This time I'll use a tin can, a quart of milk, a slice of quiche lorraine, a bulky antique quilt, a vat of quicksilver, and a quartz pebble. Try and find some way of splitting them into two groups. And don't tell me the pattern! Just age one group and de-age the other and let me guess." Ginger grabs a tin can and places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye. > NEW The can leaps into the air with a bang and comes down as a chunk of tin and a much larger chunk of iron, with a pile of carbon. Ginger takes the transformed tin can and places it in a large box. Ginger writes, "Interesting, Fred." Ginger grabs a quart of milk and places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye. > OLD The carton churns and pops as something inside moves about violently. The carton begins to blacken and decay. It peels off to reveal a perfect gorgonzola cheese. Ginger takes the transformed quart of milk and places it in a large box. Ginger writes, "I've got some ideas about which classification you chose, but I'm not quite there yet." Ginger grabs a slice of quiche lorraine and places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye. > OLD The slice of quiche lorraine turns grey, and then green. Large mold colonies sprout out, forming towers of red, green, and gold. Ginger takes the transformed slice of quiche lorraine and places it in a large box. Ginger writes, "I definitely have a theory, Fred. Keep them coming! I want to win." Ginger grabs a bulky antique quilt and places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye. > OLD The quilt ages gracefully. The price label changes to read $40000, then $100000. Then a small rip appears in the quilt, and the label changes to $12.59. Ginger takes the transformed bulky antique quilt and places it in a large box. Ginger writes, "Aha! My theory has been confirmed. Just one more experiment, and I'll tell you what I think." Ginger grabs a vat of quicksilver and places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye. > NEW The vat of quicksilver bubbles and boils and settles down as a vat of cinnabar. Ginger takes the transformed vat of quicksilver and places it in a large box. Ginger writes triumphantly, "Well, I guessed it, Fred. You've been deaging everything that's inorganic and aging everything else. Great idea! I love it!" She writes SUCCESS in her journal in giant letters. "Well", she types, "I guess it's time to try it out." She stands on the rejuvenator, and presses a button. There is a bright flash of light, and a middle-aged woman reappears. Ginger checks that her lab coat and glasses still fit. She snaps by her ears, and smiles; her hearing defect must be repaired again. An alarm buzzes, and the terminal flashes a message: FIRE IN SECTOR 3. Ginger sees the message. She looks at the camera and says, "Thanks Fred, I love you!" before running out of the room. She bumps into the rejuvenator on the way out, and sparks fly out for a second before fading. [New recording - Love] It seems Ginger broke something in the rejuvenator. You should really get that fixed before the judging ceremony, Dr. Law. > X GENERATOR I didn't understand the object in that command, Dr. Law. > X REJUVENATOR The rejuvenator is a metal platform shaped like an elaborately carved eye whose pupil is glowing. It is capable of supporting one or two individuals. It is a single step up from the floor. > U There are no cameras in that direction, Dr. Law. > N MOIRAI Living Quarters You see a natural cavern filled with gold coins and jewelry.

Fred looks for Ginger, but only finds her journal, which still says SUCCESS written in giant letters. He cackles, and climbs on the platform. He pushes a button, and pulls a lever. The machine is building up. > Z Okay, Dr. Law. I'll wait. There is a flash of brilliant light. You now see a young version of Fred, approximately 5 years old. He looks around the room with wide eyes. A hiss of steam from a machine startles him, and he says, "Mytyeh gogo?" A light flashes on the terminal, and he says, "Mytyeh gogo?" in a higher voice. He sees something that makes him smile and runs out of the room. You can hear him to the north.

And with that"--Dr. Law whips the cover off the bier, revealing a cryogenically frozen Labrador--"I will fulfill my decade-long dream of restoring Cerberus, my beloved childhood pet, to life." Dr. Law carefully opens the bier, and gently lifts Cerberus out and into the cloning machine. The machine smokes and bubbles, and a healthy, living Labrador falls out of the machine with a 'plop'. As Cerberus licks Dr. Law's face, he waves at the camera, and says, "Thank you, nameless benefactor!" All of the doctors gather together and chant your name: "Nameless Benefactor! Nameless Benefactor! Nameless Benefactor!" The machine starts smoking again, and another Dr. Law falls out with a "plop", followed by another Labrador. Everyone stops. "Oops," says Dr. Spiel.

[ACTION] read [STATE]  I'd like to acknowledge my three biggest influences for this game: Hacker, by Activision; Portal, by Valve; and A Mind Forever Voyaging, by Infocom. Hacker was a game that really intrigued me in elementary school; it started as a password login screen on an old Apple II, and you had to try to crack the password. I never got very far, but I'll always remember that opening. Portal and GladOS are the main inspiration for my computer system DaedalOS, although with less murderous intentions. A Mind Forever Voyaging takes the form of a computer system with menus, and with different cameras accessible in a building, mixed with some exploration and recording. It strongly influenced me. A few other games had direct influences. I copied the three-part structure of Detectiveland because I liked how big it made the game feel (other games have used this before, too, like The Edifice). The puzzles in this game were designed to represent my favorite types of puzzles in Interactive Fiction, including the "zooming in" puzzles found in Lime Ergot, Toby's Nose and Out of the Study; the giant desk puzzles of The Reluctant Resurrectee; the optimization/scavenging puzzles from Moments Out of Time, Captain Verdeterre's Plunder or the original Adventure; the language puzzles from the Edifice and the Gostak, and my own conversation puzzles in Color the Truth; the war mech puzzle from The Duel that Spanned the Ages and the battle puzzles in Gun Mute and Attack of the Robot Killer Yeti Zombies; the reflection puzzle from Tookie's Song; the Babel fish puzzle from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; the entire game of Grandma Bethlinda's Variety Box; and the presentations from the Art of Misdirection and Fair. The rejuvenation pattern puzzle is, as far as I can recall, original. The correct-sequence puzzle with Spiel's clones is an old class of puzzle.
