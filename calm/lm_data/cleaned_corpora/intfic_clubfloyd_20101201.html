[ACTION] examine man [STATE] (the gaunt young man) A gaunt young man huddles on an office chair in the far corner of the room, clothed only in a pair of navy sweatpants.  He is slumped forward in a hunch, the outline of his spine standing sharply against the skin of his emaciated back.  His face is obscured by a mass of messy, tangled brown hair. You feel drawn to the young man.  The feeling vibrates between empathy and sympathy.  You can all-too-easily imagine the slight chill of the air against his bare back, the way his elbows dig into his knees, and the slight ache of his spine from the unnatural posture.

Industrial washers and dryers line the walls of this room, and three canvas-walled carts filled with dirty linens squat awaiting their purpose.  The room stinks of offal, blood and bleach all at the same time.  On the east wall, a large sink made of heavy-duty steel sits, but its long faucet is bent at a peculiar angle and it is missing both handles.  A particularly large laundry machine looms at the end of the row. There's a human skeleton lying on the tiled floor.  It's wearing a very clean lab coat. An open door leads south out of the room.

Not that you can do much in the lab except point and instruct.  That's why you need Rayjay - his steady hands are your hands now, and his confidence in you keeps you centered.

Airy Hospital May 8th, 1978 Well! Dr. Yehuda has come to requisition supplies as he said he might, but I daresay I expected the man to be more composed when he did so. He was wild-eyed when he came to my office, with the air of a fugitive who had just escaped a pursuer. It was therefore somewhat less of a surprise when he asked that I not report the requisition to Mr. Cross. Much as I would have liked to use the information as a bargaining chip, I am inclined to be more lenient to Dr. Yehuda as opposed to Cross, not to mention the fact that any requisition at all would give me information that I didn't have before. Though suspicious, I therefore consented. Dr. Yehuda asked for a dose of liquid tyramine for synthesis, as well as a drug that contained diazepam, benzodiazepenes, and beta blockers. Concerning the tyramine, I knew that the hospital had only one supply of the stuff suitable for the lab, and that went by the brand name Vanemine. We also had a cocktail matching the doctor's second request, which sold under the brand name Sandepam. I assured him that both would be made available to him. As soon as I was clear of the Doctor, I began researching his choices, starting with the most specific and targeted. Given its specific chemical cocktail, Sandepam is primarily kept as a treatment for a potentially fatal adrenergic storm. While there are a lot of causes of such a condition, an overdose of tyramine is one. I can assume, then, that the relationship between the drugs is causal. So why would he need tyramine in the first place? I have trouble believing that Corona has hired out an annex to research some kind of advanced "cheese effect." Given the secretive and dangerous air about the project combined with a need for high levels of a potentially life-threatening norepinephrine, I can only assume that they are playing with McMoneagle's brain. Are they trying to create a supersoldier? An advanced neurotoxin? This is too dangerous. I've got to get to the bottom of it, even if it puts my position in danger. [ACTION] west

As soon as I was clear of the Doctor, I began researching his choices, starting with the most specific and targeted. Given its specific chemical cocktail, Sandepam is primarily kept as a treatment for a potentially fatal adrenergic storm. While there are a lot of causes of such a condition, an overdose of tyramine is one. I can assume, then, that the relationship between the drugs is causal. So why would he need tyramine in the first place? I have trouble believing that Corona has hired out an annex to research some kind of advanced "cheese effect." Given the secretive and dangerous air about the project combined with a need for high levels of a potentially life-threatening norepinephrine, I can only assume that they are playing with McMoneagle's brain. Are they trying to create a supersoldier? An advanced neurotoxin? This is too dangerous. I've got to get to the bottom of it, even if it puts my position in danger.

As I've said in my notes, Ian is showing a great deal of promise in remote viewing. He's able to come up with at least one salient, unique detail about anything he is asked to see.  Over the past day or two, his "scrying" has been strikingly accurate, including not only corroborating details but also an understanding of the situations he has been asked to view. Today's trial, though, has left me with a nasty sense of foreboding.  Dr. Atwater had just excused himself to make a run to the convenience store, so I proposed to Ian that he perform a viewing on the doctor.  I was initially merely disappointed when Ian described an office within the facility, indicating guesswork on Ian's part.  After that, the boy became seriously agitated, babbling about being in danger.  He dissolved into a panic attack and spoke very fast. It was hard to understand him, but he seemed to be saying that Cross and Dr. Atwater were "out to get him," claiming that "they want to terminate me." I did my best to placate the poor boy, but he was having none of it.  By the look in his eyes, he seemed to be caught in the vision and unable to escape it.  After a few minutes, I saw no recourse but to tranquilize him and have him moved back to his room under supervision. Once awake, he was very paranoid, still believing firmly that Cross and Dr. Atwater were conspiring to end his life.  By my estimation, this must have been his nightmares bleeding over into his visions, tainting them with the paranoia of being chased on a nightly basis. It's possible that Ian's abilities interpreted Dr. Atwater's departure from the facility as abandonment, termination. It's the best that I can guess. There is a part of me that believes that I should have put all of this into the official report.  Instead, I used the most generic terms I could.  Panic attack.  Adverse effects.  Unexpected delusions. Why not the truth, Theo?  You are a Doctor and an employee of Corona.  They don't pay you to omit details. The truth is ... by now, I trust Ian's abilities more than I trust Dr. Atwater's belief in the project.

[STATE] This corpse is fresh, and, from what you can tell, hastily-stowed in this drawer.  Before death, Dr. Yehuda was a somewhat overweight middle-aged man.  Although he was stacked face down, his head is turned to the side, away from his grisly companion, so you can see that his face looks tired but kindly.

His features are those of a man in his middle age, but his face is craggy for its youth. The corpse has bags under its closed eyes and stress lines on its brow. The corpse has clearly been autopsied and embalmed, as its naked, pale skin shows no sign of decay.  There are also no visible injuries on this corpse. [ACTION] search upper corpse

Lightning fast, one of the fleshy tentacles wraps around you with crushing force.  You set your heels and lean back against the pull of the tentacle, but you are unable to maintain your footing.  With a sudden jerk, the fleshy muscle jerks you forward and you stumble directly into the mass of pulsating flesh.

Dr. Ephart follows close enough behind to step on his heels.  "How many fingers do you see?" Dr. Shaunessy asks, kneeling down beside you, and Dr. Ephart rests light fingers on your wrist to take your pulse.

Though you can nearly stand on your own, the doctors firmly escort you from the room and off to bed. Dr. Shaunessy leaves, but Dr. Ephart stays with you as the sedatives take hold.

A little bit of snooping would have saved me a world of horror.  While I knew that Ian was not the first subject of Corona's experiments, what I did not know was exactly how the others had been deemed unsuitable.  I wonder if "Reacted poorly to the symbiont" managed to make it onto their epitaphs, or whether it was scrawled in the margins of a toe tag.  Knowing what I have learned about Corona, I would be surprised if they lent even that much dignity to their "lab rats." The cherry on the proverbial sundae: their very best metric of success, the sign that they are on the right track: the death of a researcher at the hands of a psychic test subject, purposefully hopped up on a potentially fatal brain-eating symbiont. This has to stop. I am working on an inoculation against the symbiont.  The fact that Ian survived it is a good sign that his own psychic ability might be enough to withstand its death. The theory is as follows: I need a sample of the symbiont, dead, just as for a standard vaccine.  This should be easy; Atwater indicated to me in April that the symbiont died in response to standard chemicals, so long as it wasn't already in a living being's system.  A dose of the vaccine would be enough to kill the symbiont itself, but its bond with Ian's mind will be harder to break.  With this in mind, a very strong dose of tyramine will give him the adrenal spike he needs to break that psychic link. He'll need almost immediately to take a strong dose of medicine to stave off an adrenergic storm; that amount of tyramine would be fatal to anyone, even a psychic of his stature.  With that in mind, I have requisitioned a drug with enough levels of diazepam, benzodiazepenes and beta blockers.  If he takes them in turn, it'll be hell on his system ... but he will live and the symbiont won't. I have the diazepam formula. I just hope I can get ahold of the tyramine-fortified vaccine before that spook, Cross, realizes what I'm up to. - Theo Yehuda Below, you find a recipe detailing the creation of a vaccine.

Such tremendous cost of research! Such lucrative pay for the staff! Such reparations to the families of the dead! This project has killed fifteen fools who believed themselves to be psychic. I would painstakingly run them through personality tests, IQ tests, psychological profiles. They would pass muster or fail, and those who failed would be turned away. The poor fools who pass receive the treatment that will inevitably kill them. I'm not sure that they've even told the new project head, Yehuda, how many subjects have died thanks to the "symbiont." Symbiont. Pah. I'm no microbiologist, but I recognize the symptoms of a parasite when I see one, and this one has killed everyone that it's been fed to. The thing dies like any other microorganism when exposed to formaldehyde in the lab as when creating a vaccine, but once it's in the body there's no cure. The little beasts go straight to the brain, the subject goes mad and then dies in an out-of-control adrenergic storm that even a near-lethal dose of diazepam won't stop. And now we're looking for another one. At this rate, we'll never get the contract -- at the very least, someone needs to live through the damn infection. [ACTION] examine debris

It feels like he's putting a lot of trust in me, even though he doesn't like to talk about his nightmares or his past. He seems to be afraid of himself, and said over and over that he didn't want to hurt anybody. He's afraid, he says, and he doesn't want to hurt anybody. It was hard not to laugh at the notion of Ian hurting anybody. He wouldn't -- couldn't -- hurt a fly. He really didn't want to fall asleep, but eventually he just couldn't stay up any longer. I tucked him in and tried to make him as comfortable as I could for when the nightmares came. I think I'm developing feelings for Ian. His eyes are so expressive and he feels for other people so keenly. Unprofessional or not, Ian's a really special person and I hope Corona's able to cure him of whatever it is that he's got.

The substance seems to have a life of its own, pulsing and undulating in great colonies. Large piles of it merge and separate. The room itself seems to have been some kind of biological experimentation laboratory. You can see a large sink along one wall, with nozzles for a bunsen burner mounted next to it. While most of the counters are covered with the disgusting red substance, one table is mostly untouched thanks to an overhanging edge. On the table is a measuring pipette, fixed in place above a wooden test tube rack.  There's also a small lab refrigerator branded with a biohazard symbol. The bottom of a glass test tube projects from a mound of the mealy red stuff. [ACTION] examine rack [STATE] A wooden rack with holes and divots for holding test tubes.  It's currently empty.

But I have been here for years, now, and overseen the snuffing out of over a dozen lives. With each death I hope to the godless heavens that Corona will see the depth of its mistake, realize that experimenting with a lethal parasite and calling it a symbiont will not make wishes come true. If we want to join the Project it will only be through methodical chicanery, not methodical murder. What do they want of me? To become McMoneagle's friend, like "kindly old Doc Yehuda?" To have faith in the absence of reason, like "Crazy 'Lainey?" I dread to think of how crushed they will be when the young man's brain floods itself with chemicals. I will be the only staff member in his right mind. I am not a monster. I am a doctor. To hell with anyone who doesn't understand that. [ACTION] examine vial

On it, a corpse in a cut-up suit has been laid in a spread-eagled position, with dozens of surgical tools protruding from its dissected torso.  Flaps of skin from the corpse's torso stretch towards the ceiling, suspended by thin pieces of surgical thread. A door made of heavy, insulated glass leads to another room to the east.

The single working fluorescent light here flickers slightly, giving your movement a cinematic cast to it.  The east wall of the morgue is lined with large drawers for corpse storage, like a giant, morbid filing cabinet.  Along the north wall is a counter with a large industrial sink.  Nearby, a hospital gurney squats at an odd angle, one of its wheels bent sharply to the side. There is a spatter of dried blood on the drawers, marring the otherwise spartan cleanliness of the area.  The doors beneath the large counter stand open, exposing steel pipes and a wastebasket. A heavy glass door to the west leads back to the autopsy room. There's a small, circular pile of ash below drawer 6. Drawer number 6 is open, exposing an empty tray. [ACTION] examine wastebasket

He's always so stiff and formal, which makes sense, since he's working with Dr. Ensfield all the time - but Rayjay's sour too, and that worries you.  Dr. Ensfield's not sour.  Plus, Rayjay is the only person anywhere near your age at Corona, and it would be nice if he weren't such a grapefruit. A groaning noise comes from above.  Looking up, you discover a maze of pipes wending over the ceiling and down the walls - pipes that, Best thinks dazedly, almost certainly weren't there at lunchtime. But this isn't you.

[ACTION] read notes [STATE] The small page torn from a compact notebook reads: S.C. - Entry 1978-05-07-0400 "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy." Atwater spoke to me about the possibility of terminating McMoneagle. It is true and observable that Ian has suffered more severe effects than any of the previous test recipients had before their brains succumbed to the symbiont's side effects. Since Atwater has never had faith in the possible success of the project, psychotic reactions hold no hope for him. He would just as soon destroy the subject and move to the next. What I did not know upon this meeting is that Atwater had given an innocuous excuse to Yehuda concerning his absence from the test -- a trip to the store. This rendered him an adequate target for a remote viewing session, by Yehuda's reckoning. Ian "overheard" Atwater's conversation with me and became overwrought. When he went to sleep, his psychic abilities manifested, somehow dealing severe trauma to Atwater's heart. By the time the doctor was taken to the hospital, he was already dead. While I was notified almost immediately, this is going to be incredibly inconvenient to keep quiet and controlled. Elaine should be easy to manipulate; her faith in the project will ensure her loyalty. Yehuda will be another matter. I will speak to him directly, but even then I will need to keep an eye on the man. He has too much humanity to be a good Doctor. I realize that it is my job to babysit the ignorant, but that does not keep it from being infuriating. [ACTION] turn off torchiere

[ACTION] east [STATE] As you open the windowless door, you interrupt the insulated barrier that was preventing sound from leaving the test chamber.  The sound of screaming suddenly goes from a muted, ignorable presence to a hammering agony on your ears.

The door slams shut behind you with tremendous force. Test Chamber, Mt Airy Hospital While you are not entirely sure what you expected to find, you are halted in your tracks nonetheless.  The floor of the test chamber is littered with glittering shards of reflective glass.  The one-way mirror between the test chamber and the observation room is opaque, but it pushes outward in the center to form a pair of jagged, irregular halves like a pair of jaws.  From the hips up, Ian McMoneagle is trapped in the grip of those jaws, his face twisted into a mask of pain.  The mirror's halves grind against muscle and bone, tearing him apart as they draw him in.  And yet he lives....

What lies on the ground is a set of twelve six-sided game dice, each one showing a single pip facing upward.  Six sets of snake eyes stare up at you and Ian.  You stare back. The room vibrates for a few seconds, and then reality shatters.  You both shatter with it. Press any key to continue. A darkened office. The orange light of dusk spilling through venetian blinds, laying bright stripes on the dark wood of an expensive luxury desk. With a satisfying clatter, six dice bounce across the surface of the desk, coming to rest with assorted results: 6 6 2 6 3 1.  The man who threw them, a middle-aged man with a face craggier than his age should allow, wears Brylcreemed black hair, a power suit, and the receiver of an office telephone held firmly to the side of his head. "No, John, let me tell YOU something," he says. "The Schuyler family didn't get to be where it is because we refused to take risks.  This stuff is the real deal, and whoever pulls it off first is going to be set for generations." He grabs three of the dice, leaving the three that show sixes.  With an offhand gesture, he tosses them again.  One of the three comes up a six.  "Look, this Buchanan broad is too hippy dippy for the Institute, but she's the real deal and she'll do anything for a break.  They want to look legit, fine, but they won't land the project.  We will." He picks up one of the unlucky dice, then the other.  He pauses for a moment, listening to the phone, then laughs.  "Well, John, I imagine she'll go nuts after a little while, but if you're not willing to squeeze an orange hard enough, you'll never get a glass of juice. Well, all right John.  Talk to you later." The man hangs up the phone, then throws the final two dice one last time.  Both come up sixes.  He leans back in his chair and smiles. "Heh-heh," he says. "Yahtzee." Then, he puts five dice back in the game box and one die in his pocket, and he saunters off to dinner. *** Your ending is The House Always Wins. *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?

Dr. Ephart is missing. Dr. Shaunessy has a closed eye on his forehead.  So does Rayjay.  So does Best.  They all do. You open your mouth to say something, but the noise that comes out is scarcely more coherent than a frightened blubber.  Dr. Shaunessy opens his mouth, but all that you can hear is a bizarre echoing noise that bounces around the inside of your head like an over-loud metro announcement in an empty station.  You try to speak again, but the noise you make sounds like nothing you could ever produce. Concerned, the team surrounds you, staring down.  You shrink down into your pillow, looking fearfully from third eye to closed third eye. The eyes are going to open.  You can feel it.  You can sense it.  You shrink back with terror - and then you shriek with it, clawing for escape. Best and Rayjay grab your arms, lightning quick.  It's all too much - pinned down, you faint away. Press any key to continue. Your fitful consciousness leads the doctors to strap you down to your own bed.  You flit in and out of restless sleep, beset by nightmares that stalk you through the waking world with just as much confidence as the sleeping world.  You feel the eyeballs in the walls; you feel the chewing in your mind.  Ian's keening echoes in your manacles. Simon Cross tears off his fingers and leaves them in your water glass. Best's warm smile turns into a frozen stare and then a full-throated scream of horror when the eyeballs ripple open on her right arm. Best flees your room, still screaming, and you don't know what happens after that.  Don't you?  You don't. Press any key to continue. You'd like to think you don't.  But you do.  You know how Best pats at her arm and pushes at the deformity and tries to close it, hide it, lock it away somehow, sobbing helplessly, hating herself for the breakdown even as she breaks down.  The eyelashes flutter against her fingertips, and she screams in pain when she pokes the iris accidentally. She can't hide and the other doctors find her, but when she looks at them, they recoil from her - from themselves - from the walls - and they can see what you see.  They see the third eyes, tightly shut; the eyes in the walls, staring and open; the lines of typewritten text that headless Ian, keening in despair, draws around them like a noose. Elaine Buchanan stands at your bedside, stroking your hair as they die.  Her handwriting covers the walls and she writes straight through the eyeballs without stopping.  Sclera drips from her fingers as topsoil drips from her shoulders. There's nothing you can do.  It's out and you can't keep it in. There's nothing at all that you can do.....

You fight to understand.  You were unconscious for three days, he tells you, after collapsing during a memory test.  The project will continue if you feel up for it after a few days of rest, but right now everyone's going to take it easy. You want to know where Dr. Ephart went.  Dr. Shaughnessy says that she was transferred to another project because she adjusted your medication doses inappropriately, contributing to your attack.  In the corner, the chestnut-haired woman with the bullet eyes stares at you. It all seems wrong, wrong.  Everyone is alive and dead.  Walking around one moment, shambling with fatal wounds the next. Nightmares plague you that night - Dr. Ephart, confused and protesting, gunned down by the chestnut-haired woman; Dr. Ensfield screaming and covering his ears in an elevator shaft; Rayjay Farley staring into static as the static takes him apart.  And Ian.  Over and over, that young man from the test chamber in Mt. Airy Hospital - Ian McMoneagle, wild with fear and guilt, being devoured by the walls. Press any key to continue. You can guard your words. But you can't stop your dreams. You can't stop your nightmares. You can't stop this from happening all over again. It's inside you. It's inside you. IT'S INSIDE YOU. And you had the chance to stop it. But you can't stop it now. Press any key to continue. Your protestations turn to abjurations.  Your abjurations turn to ravings.  You must make them listen, and your efforts become more violent; you plead, you cry, you lose control, you scream and rave. It is not long before the youngest and strongest of the staff, Rayjay and Best, strap you to your bed with sad, worried eyes. But straps will only hold you down while you're still harmless. Once it gets out they'll all die. Just like you saw. Three days later, your dreams come to life in Corona Labs. No one escapes alive. *** Your ending is The Wheel. *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?

You blink awake slowly in your room at modern-day Corona Labs.  Your third eye seems to flicker open before your real ones do; you find yourself unconsciously probing the room.  There are people here, and they are familiar to you.  They are alive.  They are your team.  You blink your way to bleary-eyed consciousness and turn your head slightly to look at them. There they all are, gathered in a ring at the foot of your bed: Dr. Shaunessy, the neurologist; Best Ife, the lab tech; the wheelchair-bound Dr. Ensfield, previously familiar to you only at a distance, with his assistant Rayjay Farley; and Dr. Ephart.   Their attention is focused on Dr. Shaunessy, who is reporting from a clipboard that he taps occasionally with a pen.  Dr. Ensfield nods rhythmically as his colleague speaks. "... will definitely survive, and will probably wake up soon, having stabilized naturally from the spike.  There isn't anything we could do, but it seems as though the problem cleared up on its own." Unnoticed, you open your mouth and work your jaw for a moment.  It feels like a long time since you spoke to anyone.  Dr. Ensfield says, "But at this time, we can't verify any activity whatsoever from the N. splendens culture." "That's because it's dead," you say. Press any key to continue. The group turns to you as one, surprise in every eye.  "Look who's awake!" Dr. Ephart says fondly, breaking into a wide grin.  Her expression sobers, then, as she comes to you. "You gave us quite a fright, passing out for days like that.  But Dr. Ensfield informs us that you took care of the problem all on your own, so good going there." "We'll let Ms. deVries know that the patient is awake," Dr. Ensfield says. "And discourage her from visiting," Rayjay adds. Dr. Shaughnessy looks at you with calculating eyes. "I'm gonna assume you've had some weird dreams," he says to you carefully, tapping the pen in his hand against his lab coat.  "Your REM was pretty crazy - for days.  So were your EEG readings.  I'm gonna assume you've had some weird dreams -" Because we all had some weird dreams.  But he doesn't say it. You nod, and he nods.  He says, "I'm not sure what happened with you or how much you know, but I've been consulting with Dr. Ensfield, and we should talk." "But not now," Dr. Ephart says. "What we need now is a moment of calm." Dr. Shaughnessy nods and walks out of the room, following Rayjay and Dr. Ensfield. Press any key to continue. But not everyone leaves.  Best folds her arms and leans her slender frame against the door.  Dr. Ephart drags a chair next to your bed and lowers herself into it.  She looks at you, her eyes showing concern and a certain degree of assessment. "I'm sorry, kiddo," she says, patting your arm. "I never really knew how deep this rabbit hole goes.  If I had, I might have made some of my choices differently." You place a hand over hers. "You've figured some things out with that killer brain of yours, haven't you," she asks.  You wince at the adjective, but nod.  "I thought so," she says.  "I had a... funny feeling."  Dream. She continues.  "I don't know what you've figured out exactly, but I need you to be careful.  The company's sent a representative, and Best figured out that she's cased everybody's office.  If we'd been writing down some of the things we've figured out in the past few days, we could be in real trouble." She fixes you with a steady gaze.  You return it, your eyes locked on hers.  Something passes between you, and you both nod at once. "We've got a lot to talk about," she says. "I'm going to sleep with one eye open until we get this all sorted out." Marnie pats your hand once more, then stands.  She turns and nods to Best, who walks out into the hallway, looks left and right, then moves out of sight of the doorway.  Marnie walks over to the television, leans down, and presses a button on the VCR, then the TV.  The ending of American Beauty comes on.  She walks out of the room, giving a small wave to you as she goes. Press any key to continue. You lean back and close your eyes, trying to settle your jangling nerves and come to terms with... everything.  As you think things over, the movie comes to a close.  Lester Burnham speaks from the screen.  His voice flows over you like water over stone as he delivers his final speech. As he reflects on the last moments of his "stupid little life," you think on the most recent events in yours. You smile quietly.  You're seeing things differently too, now, and so is Marnie Ephart.

(y/n) > One Eye Open An Interactive Nightmare by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine  After only ten days, you're becoming surprisingly comfortable with life as a Corona Corporation guinea pig.  It helps that your routine is so reliable - meals, exercise, rest, and sleep are clearly arranged on a schedule hanging beside the white clock in your room.  As for the tests - well, you've grown used to the sight of your blood in a sample vial, and the rest is mostly paperwork.  Personality tests, aptitude tests, intelligence tests, psychological tests, Rorschach and the MMPI and even kinetic family drawing... you're starting to worry that they'll run out of tests by the end of the month. Although 7:30 PM is always the day's last test, you never leave your room alone, so you were still watching American Beauty when Dr. Marnie Ephart knocked at the door.  "Oh, you're almost to the end!" she said brightly, seeing the screen.  "I can wait until you're through." "No, that's fine."  You hit PAUSE to freeze Angela in mid-motion as you got up from the couch.  "I've seen it before."  Last Monday, actually.  The video collection isn't that good, and, considering what they're paying you, it's a pity Corona couldn't invest in a few more options.  It's hard to complain, though; the staff is friendly, the tests aren't hard, and the salary is great. During the day, Raymond, Best, or one of the scientists might be around, but at night, it's usually just the two of you, and the hall you cross now is deserted.  You accompany her through the antechamber and into the main testing chamber.  By now, you're used to being watched from behind one-way glass, but the observational room is fully lit today, and you can easily see inside. "Back in a moment," Dr. Ephart says cheerfully.  "See you on the other side!" Test Chamber, Corona Labs In the center of the room, a single black office chair sits in front of a broad, heavy desk.  The desk and chair are familiar, but the wireless keypad sitting on the desk is new.  There are five large white buttons on the keypad, each displaying a different symbol in broad black strokes.  The symbols are a circle, a cross, a set of three wavy lines, a square, and a five-pointed star.  As always, you are quite aware of the cameras watching you from above. To the west, a windowless door separates the testing room from the antechamber outside. The familiar black office chair sits invitingly nearby. Through the thick pane of glass, you can see the curved desk in the observational room. [ACTION] inventory
[STATE] Would you like to proceed?  (y/n) > One Eye Open An Interactive Nightmare by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine  After only ten days, you're becoming surprisingly comfortable with life as a Corona Corporation guinea pig.  It helps that your routine is so reliable - meals, exercise, rest, and sleep are clearly arranged on a schedule hanging beside the white clock in your room.  As for the tests - well, you've grown used to the sight of your blood in a sample vial, and the rest is mostly paperwork.  Personality tests, aptitude tests, intelligence tests, psychological tests, Rorschach and the MMPI and even kinetic family drawing... you're starting to worry that they'll run out of tests by the end of the month. Although 7:30 PM is always the day's last test, you never leave your room alone, so you were still watching American Beauty when Dr. Marnie Ephart knocked at the door.  "Oh, you're almost to the end!" she said brightly, seeing the screen.  "I can wait until you're through." "No, that's fine."  You hit PAUSE to freeze Angela in mid-motion as you got up from the couch.  "I've seen it before."  Last Monday, actually.  The video collection isn't that good, and, considering what they're paying you, it's a pity Corona couldn't invest in a few more options.  It's hard to complain, though; the staff is friendly, the tests aren't hard, and the salary is great.

A pile of shattered bones, gore and viscera lies in a wide cone, sprayed toward the door through which you entered.  Blood drips from the walls and ceiling in the shape of that same cone, pelting you with a gentle crimson rain.  The most complete part of the remains is a single high-heeled shoe, which lies just in front of the pile.  The ficus tree that previously stood in the corner now lies on its side, its leaves glistening with blood.  Its pot, now cracked, lies on its side in a pile of blood-drenched topsoil. [ACTION] east

The sound of screaming suddenly goes from a muted, ignorable presence to a hammering agony on your ears. The screaming from inside the test chamber hammers down, not only on your ears, but on your mind.  The world warps strangely around you, and, quite abruptly, you are somewhere else. The door slams shut behind you with tremendous force. Test Chamber, Mt Airy Hospital While you are not entirely sure what you expected to find, you are halted in your tracks nonetheless.  The floor of the test chamber is littered with glittering shards of reflective glass.  The one-way mirror between the test chamber and the observation room is opaque, but it pushes outward in the center to form a pair of jagged, irregular halves like a pair of jaws.  From the hips up, Ian McMoneagle is trapped in the grip of those jaws, his face twisted into a mask of pain.  The mirror's halves grind against muscle and bone, tearing him apart as they draw him in.  And yet he lives.... Ian McMoneagle looks you in the face with wide, terrified eyes, his bloody bangs obscuring his gaze but not reducing its weight.  He opens his mouth and screams in guilty agony. The mirror pulls Ian in more deeply.  The hideous cracking sound that follows is almost surely his pelvis. [ACTION] inject ian
