[STATE]  Lobby (by the sushi bar) Tucked into the corner of the lobby is the "Kamikaze Sushi Bar". It's not really a bar at all: just a counter with some stools at which guests can sit to eat sushi, brought to them from some hidden recess by the Bar's dedicated waiter. The General Manager is perched on a stool at the bar, picking at a plate of sushi. Across the lobby, Mrs Slocombe contemplates the empty reception desk with some annoyance. [ACTION] examine desk [STATE] It is axiomatic that the reception desk should always be staffed in any well managed establishment. So it is not surprising that this one isn't. Beside the desk, a brass-framed sign tells you what is happening in the hotel today. A coloured brochure lies on the desk. Across the lobby, the cat casts envious glances towards the sushi bar.

A lady of a certain age, she has lived in a suite for as long as anyone can remember.

Her cat, Pussykins, is, as usual, in attendance, glaring with feline malice from the top of her open handbag. Across the lobby, Mrs Slocombe carefully folds and unfolds her umbrella.
