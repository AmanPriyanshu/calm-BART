[STATE]  Tavern Common Room Bright and shadowy, all at once, this tavern common room is covered in countless burning candles of various shapes, sizes, and colors.  This perpetual candlelight has been happening for so long, the floor is covered in dry candle wax, stamped into a dust that has become one with the floor.  The wooden walls and ceiling are completely covered in soot and the patrons through the many decades have taken it upon themselves to scrawl graffiti in it with their fingers and knives. Across from the front door to the east is a large, curved bar, covered in candles and spirits.  In between the front door and the bar are a couple of tables and a few scattered chairs.  A wooden staircase leads up and a concealed staircase behind the bar leads down to a cellar. A raging fire is blocking any exit through the tavern's front door. It is making the tavern a boiler and the countless candles are melting rapidly as the fire spreads. Your minder, Venkath Mock, is here with a grim countenance. You can also see Sceldrus Jandol here.
