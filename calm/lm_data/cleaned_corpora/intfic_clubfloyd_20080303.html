Dozens of gleaming silver chafing dishes await your inspection, but the smell of hot food sickens you.  A massive copper samovar holds freshly brewed coffee.  Golden serving pieces have been splendidly arrayed before you, but you know you could never be allowed to pick them up and serve yourself.  If only your station in life allowed you to pack a lunch.  A roast beef sandwich and a cup of coffee eaten alone in the woods would be ideal.  Ugh, those peasant serving girls.  So crass.  Always cracking their gum and calling you "Hon." You can turn north back into the forest. The caterer responds promptly to your request for provisions.  Too promptly really, because he whisks you to the table before you can say, "And don't assign me Flo..." Your Next Meal It's you, the food-service peasants, and a long wooden table. Your older brother Vasilii is here, busily cleaning the table. An older serving woman appears at your right elbow.  "I hear you actually bagged some game today.  What did you do, read it your own poetry until it coughed up its innards?" This is the caterer's most senior serving wench, Flo.  She's known you as long as the caterer has, and she never lets you forget it.  She has an opinion about everything you ever have or haven't done in your whole life.  You've wanted to send her away many a time for the beating you think she deserves as the impudent peasant she is, but your father has always forbidden it.  He thinks some honest criticism is good for you, and he's never been in disagreement with Flo's opinions.  Oh, it would be good to be tsar and take a switch to her. You keep your cool for now.  "Wench, I am embarking on a long journey.  I require these provisions:  two sandwiches, one roast beef on rye, one sprout and avocado on whole grain.  (You assume the Firebird is a vegetarian.)  Also, bring me some rice pudding." Flo raises an eyebrow.  "Rice pudding?  I have never known you to ask for rice pudding!"  she screeches. Vasilii pricks up his ears as he labors nearby.  "He's ALLERGIC to rice pudding," he thinks, eyeing you suspiciously. As insulting as Flo can be, she would never disobey you.  In a few minutes, Flo places some provisions into your hands.  As she leaves, she wishes you godspeed on your journey. [ACTION] look
[STATE] The Firebird stops and whispers to you, "Ivan, I cannot follow you into the clearing.  Vasilii is there.  If he sees me, he may kill you in order to claim my capture for himself.  Just have some sandwiches made; get anything you like. And have them send along some rice pudding. It's my favorite, and I haven't had it in so long." As you make your way south, the Firebird calls out after you, "Ivan, if you find anything on your list there, be sure to bring it back.  You might not want to go back again." A Catering Camp Sigh!

[STATE] How could a palace be made entirely from pearls?  How many pearls would have to be mortised together to create a standing structure of this height? [ACTION] in [STATE]  a Pearly Ante Chamber The walls, the ceiling, and nearly all the objects in the room are covered in row upon row of perfectly round, white pearls.  It is a monochromatic, pixellated visual nightmare.  The only architectural features that relieve the monotony are at the far end of the room:  a door frame and doorknob covered in black pearls. The room's single occupant takes you out of the nightmare and into a dream.  A young woman is here, as beautiful to you as Venus emerging out of the ocean from an oyster.  Out of the hundreds of thousands of pearls in this room, she is indeed the only one of great price.  Her loveliness has made you speechless. She is also silent at first, studying you intently.  "I do not know who you are, sir, but you must be very clever and very brave to have made your way to my chamber. What is your name?"  she asks. "Ivan," you almost whisper, still taking her in. "I am Pearl," she laughs.  "That is the name Katschei gave me.  I don't know what my parents called me." "Then Katschei brought you here when you were very young?" "As an infant, I imagine.  I do not know a time when I was not here." "Then how do you know he is not your father?" "Because he has always boasted that he took me from a tsar and a tsarina.  The only child they ever had, he says.  He claims that he was a suitor to my mother, but she rejected him, so many years later he stole me to be raised as his bride." "Did he raise you himself?" "Oh, no.  There were many nurses and governesses and tutors here when I was a child.  But as the days grow closer to our wedding, he has been guarding me very closely, and no one is here except him and his knights."  She motions toward the door leading further into the palace. You both hear the gruff laughter of battle-toughened men.  "He raised me to be his ideal bride, but I think he did a very poor job.  I cannot abide him." Seeing her gentleness you have no trouble believing this.  You press on to a more curious subject.  "Is Katschei a bird?  Does he want a bird bride?"  You have only recently noticed her wings and lower body are that of a bird. "This is a recent transfiguration.  He placed me in this form to make me undesirable to any man who might try to steal me from him." "Once again, he did a poor job."  She turns her eyes away modestly from you and your amorous words. "If you do wish to spoil his wedding plans, I will tell you another of Katschei's failings." "Please do tell me." "He chose to confide in me the secret of his immortality and strength." "Is this the secret of where his soul is kept?" "Yes.  How do you know so much already?" You tell her about the Firebird and the other two captive birds and what they have revealed to you. "It is all true.  His body is imperishable.  His soul is in an egg, a quite well-hidden egg.  The egg is in a duck, and the duck is in a hare, and the hare nests in a great hollow log that floats in a pond in a forest of the island Bouyan.  I wish I could tell you where to find the island, but I do not know that." "Very curiously hidden.  And say I retrieved the egg.  Would simply breaking it destroy Katschei?" "Yes, but it must be broken in his sight.  You must find the egg and return. Katschei is very likely to be here feasting with his knights. You may have to fight the knights to reach him, so be sure to come ready for battle." "I will do as you say, as swiftly as I can." "Please do be swift.  The wedding is approaching very quickly."  She shows you her wedding gown, which she is decorating very delicately with pearls.  You wonder aloud how she can do it at all with those wings.  "With much difficulty," she answers with a smile. You resolve aloud to return with the egg as soon as you can.  In your own thoughts you swear very solemnly not to let Katschei touch this unspoiled beauty. [ACTION] brief

You have known the Cathedral of Our Lady since you were very small.  You have marveled at the grandness of the architecture and taken comfort in the small gestures of the priest in preparing the host for communion. Today the nave is even more beautiful to behold.  Swags of greens hang between the columns, and flowers have been banked up around the altar in abundance. Your brother Vasilii is here. Your mother, the former Firebird, is here, joyful in her return to her place as tsarina and as your mother. Your father is here, proud at witnessing your success and joyful that his wife has been returned to him. Pearl is standing near the altar, flanked by the girls who had been held captive in the copper and silver palaces. Copper is here, conversing quietly with Silver and Pearl. Silver is very animated in her conversation with the other two girls.  She's certainly not a shy person. Dimitri is here, a little overstimulated by all the people and the surroundings. Your allergist is here trying to focus Dimitri's attention on the momentous events occurring in this room. The caterer is taking a break from his preparations outside to see how events are progressing in the cathedral. Elena is here, a tsar's daughter (and Pearl's sister) in the disguise of a serving wench. Flo is here, dressed in her peasant best, beaming at you with uncharacteristic pride. The teppanyaki chefs are fascinated by the baba yaga's magical bag. They are taking turns putting their battle knives and pepper mills into the bag to give them to you as wedding presents.  You sincerely hope that they are wiping them off first. The baba yaga is here, using her magical bag as a gift-wrapping service. The archbishop is here, waiting to start the wedding mass.
