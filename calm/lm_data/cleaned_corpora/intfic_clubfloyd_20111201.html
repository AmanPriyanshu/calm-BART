[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Your name is Harriet Leitner, it's the January summer school holidays and today has been a great day. You turned six this morning! And so did your twin sister, Demi. While Demi is your twin, she is not one of those twins who looks the same as you. Mum has explained that that's because you and your sister are something called fraternal twins. You have decided that you like looking just like yourself, and Demi likes it that way, too. Today, mum and dad are hosting a fancy dress birthday party for the pair of you and six of your friends: Marion, Ayla, Pia, Sam, Vince and Jack. You're dressed as a fairy and your sister is dressed as a witch, which is what each of you wanted. You all ate heaps of lollies and played games in the morning, and now your parents have taken you to the park for lunch. While mum and dad are setting up the picnic, you and your friends are getting ready to play a game of hide and seek tip. Your sister is sitting this game out to drink some lemonade and cool down. You agree to be in, and count with your eyes shut against a tree while your friends run off and hide in the park. "... Forty-eight..." you shout at the top of your lungs. You think carefully about the next number. It's not easy counting this high, but Demi is good at it and she often helps you practise. "... Forty-nine..." you shout at the top of your lungs. "... Fifty! Ready or not, here I come!" You really want to win this game. It's time to catch your friends. <<  Press SPACE to begin  >> The Edge of the Park You're at the south edge of the park.
