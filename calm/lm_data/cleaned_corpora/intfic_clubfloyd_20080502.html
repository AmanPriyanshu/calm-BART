[STATE] Snack Bar The vending machine stands there silently. Mocking you. [ACTION] examine machine [STATE] Ah, yes, the vending machine. Like most vending machines, it is essentially a refrigerator-sized box with a glass front, behind which can be seen several rows of assorted treats. There is a panel of buttons to the side, beneath which is a slot for coins, a bill changer for paper money, and a cup for your change. Insert your money, make your selection, and your snack drops from the appropriate row into the receptacle bin at the bottom of the machine. Simple. But there is more to this vending machine than only that. You hate this vending machine. You hate it more than just about anything or anyone else in this office. This vending machine was designed to hammer home a keen sense of the futility of existence; to taunt you with life's possibilities only to forever harass and frustrate your every attempt to grasp them. The machine never has anything you want. And even if it did, you couldn't buy it because you never have any change and the machine will only take mint-condition bills crisp enough to scoop bean dip with. And even if, by some fantastic stroke of luck, you did have change, and there was something remotely edible in the machine that you actually wanted, you'd still never be able to get it, because the merchandise invariably gets stuck before dropping into the receptacle, and no amount of shaking will bring it down unless you happen to be that son of a bitch Benson, who somehow always manages to retrieve his disgusting nougat bars with a single, insultingly skillful jiggle. Otherwise, forget it. The machine is your nemesis. Someday -- and you know that day is fast approaching, you must destroy it... or it will destroy you. Benson strolls by and heads straight for the vending machine, ignoring you completely. He pops a few coins into the slot and pushes 'A'. The machine dutifully grinds out another nougat bar, which snags on the wire, like always, just before it can drop into the receptacle. Benson leans his hip against the machine and gives it a deft shove. The nougat bar shakes free immediately and drops into the receptacle.. Satisfied, he retrieves his prize, digs his change out of the change cup, and heads back to his desk, already stuffing the end of the nougat bar into his mouth as he goes. Which do you mean, the vending machine or the merchandise? There are ten rows behind the Plexiglass front, labeled A through J, corresponding to the ten buttons on the side of the machine. Row A contains those filthy nougat bars that Benson can't seem to stop stuffing down his fat, greedy hole. Every other row contains Beechnut gum. That's it. Nothing but Beechnut, Beechnut and Beechnut. You hate Beechnut. You don't know anyone who doesn't hate Beechnut. Even Benson would probably start chewing on Furman's congealed coffee grinds before shelling out for a stick of fucking Beechnut... Hey, wait a minute. Down at the bottom, in row J, something is glinting. It's a little metal key. Second from the front. Right behind a stick of Beechnut. How the mighty freaking hell did that get in there? It's part of the joke. That must be it. Benson or Furman or that bastard Biedermeyer are sneaking around here somewhere, spying on you and laughing their asses off. You are abruptly seized by an acute desire to get that key, get it no matter what the cost, and cram it down some poor joker's throat. [You have just become a little bit more steamed.] It's a little metal key, dangling right behind the first pack of Beechnut in row J. Damned if you know what it opens, though. You are currently feeling totally steamed. Getting down on your hands and knees and peering under the machine, you notice that one of the legs is slightly shorter than the other. A thin wooden shim has been wedged under the shorter leg, preventing the machine from wobbling. You also see a nickel which must have been dropped here earlier. You snooze, you lose, punk-ass, you think to yourself gleefully, pocketing the money. [You have just become a little bit less steamed.] The nickel disappears into the slot and rattles down into the guts of the machine. The machine beeps at you -- not enough money!

You insert the shiny key into the keyhole and twist it clockwise. A mechanism inside the toilet paper dispenser clicks, and the bathroom is filled with a rumbling sound. Suddenly, the entire rear wall of the stall spins on a hidden axis, taking the toilet and yourself along with it... Behind the Restroom (on the toilet) You're in a narrow, irregular passageway behind the east wall of the restroom. The walls are all dust and splintered wood and ragged plaster, and the floor is bare concrete. A thin, cringing man in the tattered remains of a business suit is standing here, grinning and cracking his knuckles. You wonder if any of the others know about this place. You sure as hell didn't. The thin man grabs your hand and starts pumping it vigorously before you can even get up off the toilet. "Hi there," he says breathlessly. "Robertson. You must have gotten my message." [You have just become a little bit more frosty.] A decrepit scarecrow of a man, Robertson appears to be in the advanced stages of some sort of horrific drug withdrawal. He jitters, frets, drools occasionally, and cracks his knuckles obsessively. Also, you notice, he has a couple of odd scars on his head, one right behind each ear. "I've been waiting back here for I don't know how long," he pants. "They tried to get me, too, you know?" Robertson recoils. "Don't ever let them put those on you! Don't EVER let them!" He rubs convulsively behind his ears. "Almost got me, you know. Almost made me love myself!" "They tried to teach me... " Robertson suddenly straightens up, darts his skinny head around like a spooked heron. He cracks his knuckles a few times. Then he leans in close. "They tried to teach me how to love," he whispers. Time passes. "But I got away, you know?" Robertson grins, and does a weird, shuffling sort of jig. "Dug my way back here. They can't find me. Don't know where to look. You know? I'm still digging, too. Pretty soon I'll break through to the outside, and then I'm out of here." At the moment, you can't think of anything intelligent to say about that, so you wisely keep your mouth shut. No point in looking stupid. At the moment, you can't think of anything intelligent to say about that, so you wisely keep your mouth shut. No point in looking stupid. Robertson shudders. "Worst thing about him is, we all know who he is, you know?" We just can't say." Robertson snaps his fingers and makes a sound like a rocket ship lifting off. "Out of here," he whispers. "I bored right through it with this," Robertson says, showing you the letter opener. "That's how I got my food, you know? That's how I put the key out for you." "Yeah, that was me," says Robertson.

Robertson grins and hunches his shoulders. "Like Batman." [ACTION] examine hole
[STATE] But you're already on the toilet. A little metal box bolted to the side of the stall. There is no toilet paper in it. There's also a little keyhole on the side facing the toilet. You didn't notice it before, since you were looking at it from the other side. You insert the shiny key into the keyhole and twist it clockwise. A mechanism inside the toilet paper dispenser clicks, and the bathroom is filled with a rumbling sound. Suddenly, the entire rear wall of the stall spins on a hidden axis, taking the toilet and yourself along with it... Behind the Restroom (on the toilet) You're in a narrow, irregular passageway behind the east wall of the restroom. The walls are all dust and splintered wood and ragged plaster, and the floor is bare concrete. A thin, cringing man in the tattered remains of a business suit is standing here, grinning and cracking his knuckles. You wonder if any of the others know about this place. You sure as hell didn't. The thin man grabs your hand and starts pumping it vigorously before you can even get up off the toilet. "Hi there," he says breathlessly. "Robertson. You must have gotten my message." [You have just become a little bit more frosty.] A decrepit scarecrow of a man, Robertson appears to be in the advanced stages of some sort of horrific drug withdrawal. He jitters, frets, drools occasionally, and cracks his knuckles obsessively. Also, you notice, he has a couple of odd scars on his head, one right behind each ear. "I've been waiting back here for I don't know how long," he pants. "They tried to get me, too, you know?" Robertson recoils. "Don't ever let them put those on you! Don't EVER let them!" He rubs convulsively behind his ears. "Almost got me, you know. Almost made me love myself!" "They tried to teach me... " Robertson suddenly straightens up, darts his skinny head around like a spooked heron. He cracks his knuckles a few times. Then he leans in close. "They tried to teach me how to love," he whispers. Time passes. "But I got away, you know?" Robertson grins, and does a weird, shuffling sort of jig. "Dug my way back here. They can't find me. Don't know where to look. You know? I'm still digging, too. Pretty soon I'll break through to the outside, and then I'm out of here." At the moment, you can't think of anything intelligent to say about that, so you wisely keep your mouth shut. No point in looking stupid. At the moment, you can't think of anything intelligent to say about that, so you wisely keep your mouth shut. No point in looking stupid. Robertson shudders. "Worst thing about him is, we all know who he is, you know?" We just can't say." Robertson snaps his fingers and makes a sound like a rocket ship lifting off. "Out of here," he whispers. "I bored right through it with this," Robertson says, showing you the letter opener. "That's how I got my food, you know? That's how I put the key out for you." "Yeah, that was me," says Robertson. "Slipped it into the machine, you know? Through the back. Figured no one'd be looking for it. Except you. Hee, hee," he giggles. "That's my secret way in, you know." Robertson grins and hunches his shoulders. "Like Batman." [ACTION] examine hole [STATE] It's about six inches across, just big enough to put your fist through.

An ancient, dusty water cooler is stashed way back in the far corner. Most of the limited floor space is occupied by a large metal drawer sticking out of the western wall at roughly knee-level. You have to practically climb over it to maneuver. You realize suddenly that Robertson has become very quiet. A dim reflection in the curved, plastic side of the water tank catches your eye. You whirl around, fists up and swinging. But the shifty bastard is too quick for you. He fends off your bare knuckles with a strength born of desperation, and plunges the blade into your throat. You go down gurgling. That crazy son of a bitch never stops grinning at you like a starving hyena, the whole damn time. *** You have totally lost it *** In this game, you have only managed to get yourself totally steamed.

No, that was more of a guttural wheeze. This is most definitely a hum. Ever-wary, you take a few prudent steps back. Suddenly, the lid flies open! A blinding white light pours out through the glass, a coruscating torrent from the machine's inner core! This is it, you think, throwing up your arms to shield your eyes. The whole thing's going nova. I'll never be frosty again -- ...and then the light is gone. Slowly, you open your eyes.

You take a deep breath. You pull the door open. The hinges creak, very slightly. Looking through the open doorway, you note with no small relief that the other side really is everything you'd always hoped it would be. Without an ounce of trepidation, you step through... Hillside You are standing at the top of a hill of velvety green, overlooking a scene of pastoral delight. In the valley below, young men and women in wispy robes frolic chastely about, dancing together amongst the wildflowers and the romping sheep. Everyone is laughing. Everyone has a pretty pink balloon that they hold by its string. It is innocence and carefree, everywhere you look. Also, you notice immediately, you are naked. Completely naked. This doesn't bother you as much as part of you thinks it should. The sun is just setting, and the sky is the beautiful color of the inside of seashells. [ACTION] inventory

[ACTION] wait [STATE] *** You have learned to love yourself *** In this game, you have finally managed to love life. This, technically, is the actual "end" of the game. You can RESTART, RESTORE and all that jazz, if you want to, just like usual, or you can read the author's POSTSCRIPT. "What? Are you shitting me? THIS is how it ends?!?" Well, yes. It took me weeks to figure out what the ending of this game should be, and when the land of fat naked men finally dawned on me, I realized that it was the only ending that could possibly make sense and still be true to the story. Then, later, I decided that it was really just a cheap, cop-out, shaggy dog ending and a lot of people would be pissed at me. Now I'm kind of leaning the other way again. But it's also occurred to me that I could use this unconventional ending as an opportunity to take an analytical crowbar, if you will, to certain pre-conceived notions we have about how IF is structured. I don't want to attach too much unwarranted significance to this: I didn't, after all, start out writing this game with these themes in mind. But various comments from my beta-testers got me thinking about these ideas, and I think they might be worth discussing, so I'll just pass them right along to you. So let this, then, be my actual contribution to IF Comp '98. If even one of these points gets mentioned on RAIF, I will feel just as rewarded as though I were already popping open that can of Ass-Kickin' Peanuts. Think about it, for a minute: Is this the most "optimal" ending in the game? (And I don't mean just because you get to read this postscript!) Are any of the endings in the game "optimal"? (I will maintain that getting crushed by the vending machine is a definite loser; otherwise, any ending is up for grabs.) Is this ending true to the story? Was it inevitable? Could this story have ended any other way? Do the motivations of the main character in a work of IF always need to be the same as the motivations of the person playing it? What if the main character is thoroughly dislikable, or his motivations morally repugnant? Does the ultimate goal of the main character in a work of IF always need to coincide with what the player feels is the "optimal" ending? If what is optimal for the player doesn't jive with what is optimal for the main character, then how does one "win" the game? Maybe you should have just tossed the paperwork in the out-tray a second time -- a winning score in less than 10 moves. Is the object of this game really to get totally frosty -- or is it to stay totally steamed? Have you actually won this game? Or am I just full of beans? This, technically, is the actual "end" of the game. You can RESTART, RESTORE and all that jazz, if you want to, just like usual, or you can read the author's POSTSCRIPT. [ACTION] examine man

[ACTION] examine man [STATE] The man is fat -- but he's fat in a very jolly, almost healthy sort of way. Firm and pudgy all around, with very shiny, rosy skin. Cherubic is the sort of word that springs to mind when you look at him, although whatever vague conceptions you ever had about cherubs (and you never had that many) generally involved little babies with wings, and this guy is in his forties if he's a day. Maybe they're branching out. He's also completely naked. But the less said about that, the better. The naked fat man is carrying a gauzy robe and a pink balloon on a long string. "You'll need these," he tells you, handing you a pink balloon and a gown of diaphanous material. "They'll help you fit in. We've tried to provide an environment for you that is safe. Something that you'll have no trouble," he adds, indicating the valley with a sweep of his pudgy hand, "...accommodating." But if you let go of the string, your balloon will fly away! "Well, enjoy your stay," says the fat naked man, clapping you heartily on the back. "Don't misbehave, now." He raises his eyebrows and taps the side of his nose, and for the first time you notice that he's wearing thick, black-framed glasses. "Remember to stay frosty," he says as he floats away into the sunset. But you hardly hear him. You are filled with a rapture, a fantastic sense of belonging like you have never before felt, as you skip down the hillside, balloon in hand. The young men and women welcome you with open arms, and everywhere sheep are bleating. You know, then, that you could never find a better place than this, even if you spent your whole life looking.
