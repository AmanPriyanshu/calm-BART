Sarah races after you, with Uncle Bucky, his hands still tied, bouncing helplessly on the saddle behind her.  Looks like a rescue, cowboy. You pass across a wide mesa and slow to a stop.  Time for a well-deserved rest.  Sarah rides up behind you, and both she and Uncle Bucky dismount.  You stand there sihouetted by the light of the Western sunset, the four of you:  you, Sarah, Bucky, and a cactus. So, how did you do?  Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer, it was in self defense.  And while you did break into Grady's liquor stash, that doesn't really count as being productive.  It would also be interesting to see who would think highly of your stealing Little Jimmy's candy.  You've also managed to completely torch a hayfield. That's something, isn't it? On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel room unnoticed.  And putting together that plan to steal Stratford's stallion showed at least a little ingenuity.  Plus, if it weren't so seedy and practically dishonest, having wits enough to bamboozle Grady with a weed looking like a four-leaf clover would almost be commendable.  Maybe you deserve some points for managing to construct a bomb out of an empty whiskey bottle and the most volatile hootch on the planet.  (Or maybe not.)  But maybe it's the score that tells the story in the end--you:  2, the Heffer family:  0. So somewhere along the way you managed to become a genuine Western hero, up there with John Wayne and Roy Rogers and the best of them--no small feat, that. *** YOU'VE WON THE GAME! *** The game has ended.
