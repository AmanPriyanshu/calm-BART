But anyway you do your best to write something good: you ask a lot of questions, write a lot of understatements, hypothesis... Even the slightest information can fill a paragraph, if you know how to do this job. Once it's finished, you switch your computer off and go home. [ACTION] look [STATE] This is your life. Funny job, when you think about it. One one hand you can see it as a shameless intrusion into people's private lives. You hide to take photos, always get second-hand information, spread some more information, spread the rumor. In the public field, your job is really not well perceived. But on the other hand, in the private field, it's very differently perceived. The moral instinct of every man and woman is to criticize gossip columns, but their social, gregarious instinct reads them with much interest. You understood quite quickly this duality. The celebrities themselves are subjected to the same duality: they openly say that they are against this press, the paparazzis and their incursions in their private life; but when you dig a little deeper, you find out that a substantial part of the information you're dealing with is provided by the celebrities themselves, and a lot of rumors were invented and spread by these little perfect smiling people. Gossip magazines are, for them, a way to harm a rival, to make people talk about them, to appear kind and sympathetic and closer to the average person because they go to the grocer just like them. You sometimes wonder if the journalists themselves aren't the most lucid people in this world. But, had "Tittle-Tattle Kettle" been a simple, tasteless gossip magazine, you'd never have taken the job. But one of this magazine's assets is Sammy: he's the man who gave this so peculiar tone to the magazine, and finally who gave his magazine bigger prospects than being just another gutter magazine. You respect him for that, and so do many people. Of course, the magazine can't avoid writing dull articles whose sole purpose is to fill the pages of the next issue; but the magazine is keen to show that it's different, by precisely, and in a clear-headed way, analyzing information, and explaining what it really means. Tracking a shameless rumor to reveal its creator, analyzing a sentence said by a star to show the true intent, showing symbols and ideologies used in an advertising campaign... TTK's style is sharp and powerful, and appears more as a shepherd than as a sheep following the flock. You're okay with that. At the beginning you took the job to pay the bills, but you gradually perceived the magazine's appeal, and what you could do in your articles. You discovered the complexity of social interactions between celebrities, in this world so elitist and yet so childish. You improved your understanding of communication campaigns. You learnt to be clear-headed. And slowly, year after year, you became one of the most competent reporters at the magazine; you witnessed your popularity rising, and your articles being more and more noticed, quoted, your arguments used elsewhere, and your influence as a journalist growing. You really like feeling that. You think about keeping this job another few years, and then changing your operating field to a more respectable press, where you'd make yourself noticed by everyone. For now, you have to go to the editorial office: Sammy left you a message saying to meet him there. Your flat This is your little flat with two rooms, downtown. Rather functional and bright, you really like it. In the sitting-room, there's a table, a few chairs, and a sofa: that's where you usually work. The kitchen is westwards, and your bedroom and the bathroom are eastwards. [ACTION] north

On the other hand, you really don't like Piranella, and it all depends on the way you write the article; you can probably make it more harmful to her than to Tyrone...

[pausing to show unread error message] Dreams, coming again and again, always unwelcome, always unwanted... Whether sadness, misery, horror or confusion, They never fail to induce negativity; in that, at least, this dream is no different. You float in void, filled with a roiling black static that seems conscious. There is nothing to see but the static, nothing to feel but your own form, and nothing to hear but the ghostly call of a child. It sets your teeth on edge even in the waking world; you can't stand that eerie wail, wavering between laughter and tears. You never find this child. Even though the sound gets closer, until it is right next to you, all around you, inside your own head before you are awakened by the alarm clock. This time, though... A figure swims out of the darkness, backlit, so that you can only make out a childlike face of tragic innocence and flowing hair. "Who... are you?" There isn't an answer right away--instead, everything around you turns completely white. And somehow... puffy. Do you know WHY you have always hated the sound, Kristen? The child, invisible now, speaks, for the first time; androgynous, cultured. You can't respond. you wish you could. It just sparks something deep within you, something primal--something below reason, below rationality, below everything but fear. You don't like it when your brain keeps secrets from you. I've waited a long time... and still am. Your surroundings flicker between the endless white and writhing black, the two merging into some unwholesome gray. Kristen... your child is waiting. "Your child is waiting." "Hmm?" "I said, your child is waiting." "WHAT?" You blinked furiously, trying to get your brain into some sense of working order; these dreams usually leave you a scattered mess, and you can't recall ever speaking to someone while that way. "I said--" The voice seemed testy. "No--stop. I heard what you said, I just... could you give me a moment?" You looked around... same bedroom, same lame-ass apartment, same everything... Awake. Normal. Except, not. You'd managed to register your ringing phone, pick it up, and get through the opener to this conversation, while sleeping. Not very like you. And she said-- You felt a chill. "...Excuse me? Did you say that I have a--" "Child, yes ma'am--waiting for you in Gainesville." Click. "I don't have a..." The retort died on your lips. The hum of a disconnected telephone answered back at you, daring you to question its integrity. Patently ridiculous. You don't have a child. You never did. How could that possibly be? There must be some mistake, some incredibly stupid bureaucratic snafu. You'd love nothing better than to explain this fact to whoever that was, but since she hung up before you could get the words out, that's not really an option. That dream... Was a dream. You dream every night, and you haven't had any come true yet. Gainesville? Where is Gainesville? Most bloody generic name for a town ever, and you don't even recall there being one here. You wouldn't even know where it is. Except... you do. The way suggested itself even as you tried to deny it, as though you had always known. You're still certain, completely, that you've never heard of the place before; even the part of your brain that showed you the way confirms this. In the end, you don't know what your motivation was: sleep deprivation, deep seated confusion, nerves... maybe your body was just tired of waiting for your brain to catch up and got you dressed and in the car before you realized. Soon you were driving, to where you weren't sure, your mind screaming MADNESS while your hands deftly twisted the steering wheel. This would bother you, give you serious pause, but you somehow feel at peace with it. All you've gotta do is remind yourself that you had nothing else planned today. Obituary  You stand up and stretch, various parts of your body making worrisome popping noises as you exit the car, noting with a vague sense of triumph that it has once again failed to cause your violent death in some spectacular fashion or other. The cold night air is chill against your skin--fortunate, then, that you brought your coat. Outskirts of Gainesville You stand on the side of the packed dirt road leading to Gainesville. The road stretches far away behind you to the south and, eventually, turns off into a paved one that leads back to the central transit explosion that is modern American transportation. Your vision of the town is obscured by the trees; all you can tell is that the path leads, for now, to the north. Your next-to useless, banged-up car is decidedly parked here. The driver's side door is shut smugly in your face. [ACTION] inventory

[STATE] Peering closer, you can see that a piece of the locking mechanism appears to have come loose; it's lying on the ground just past the gate. You could probably reach it through the bars. [ACTION] get piece [STATE] You get on your knees and start reaching through the bars. Your fingers just land on the piece of rusted metal, but can't quite close over it. Slowly you push it forward, just a few more centimeters and--got it. "She's fixing the gate!" Your head whips around to see three men running towards you from the ranch house. You pull yourself to your feet and raise your hands, trying to explain yourself, but even to your own ears the words that come out sound like babble. The men ignore you, running closer--it's then that you notice that one of them, the eldest, is armed. All right, this is getting serious. Your hand flashes inside your coat for your own gun-- "Not as clever as you thought you were. Are ya?" One of the younger men chortles this, just before the older one fires his shotgun. A load of buckshot blasts through your rib cage; however it lacks the force to create an exit wound. It's not at all like you thought it would be. All over, your body feels cold. But the wounds feel hot... you don't get that at all... As if from outside yourself, you see you slump to the ground, deep red blossoming from your chest cavity. You hear what sounds like a volcano inside your head, and look down at your body convulsing; blood flecked with mucus sprays from your mouth, staining your coat and shirt a deep crimson. Physically, you're not repulsed--you've seen worse things on TV--but the fact that that's you, this is your life draining away, is enough to send the you watching you die reeling away in a shock that feels as real as the pellets that ripped through your body not a half second ago. Before you can see anything else happen, the space before you seems to flatten out into one dimension; the ground, the sky, the gate, the house, your body lying in a pool of its own blood, the man that shot you wracking his slide and kicking out the shell on your face--all stretch out before you as if existing all on one plane. Even that slowly fades until all is gray... then black. The first sense to return is feeling: A hard surface, digging into your spine. It is uncomfortable. Though, not nearly as uncomfortable as having your lungs turned to pulp by a shotgun blast. All things are relative. You trail your fingers over your own skin, gingerly, expecting to wince from pain at any moment--but no. Nothing. There is no ragged, bloody hole in your chest. You are breathing normally. The second sense to come back is hearing, the first sound you hear being a dull thunk as your elbows accidentally smack into the walls on either side of you; the second being a muted "Sonofabitch." After that, the others come back in a rush... except for sight. Darkness It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing. [ACTION] light match

You are aware, almost as an afterthought, that you frightened beyond measure; also if you listen to this you will lose control and be gone. Methodically, you batter away at the top of the box with your hands. The first hint of a give, the acknowledgment of weakness fills you with triumph.

Your breath held, you push yourself to your feet--but it still isn't enough. Cursing your height in the back of your mind you claw desperately at the earth, shoveling handfuls off yourself as one word dominates your thoughts: UP. You tilt your head back, lungs burning, trying to spring off the wrecked boards. Your support sinks sickeningly further down into the ground but you are still able to make some sort of half-assed arching movement, just enough for your head to break the surface. You exhale and immediately inhale again, throwing your arms out in front of you, digging them into the soft earth as gravity pulls at that fucking trench coat and all the pointless useless shit in it. Your face twists itself into a rictus of determination as you rip your fingernails bloody, fighting against the weight of the earth tumbling you back into the open grave. The first few inches are the hardest ones to manage, but you do manage them, and then a few more, slowly but surely extricating yourself from the pit, just enough to allow you the leverage to push down and free your legs. You roll over onto your back, hands and feet scrabbling wildly, propelling your body away from the unstable boundaries of the hole even as it shifts and fills itself. Slowly, you sit up. It is only then you can be bothered to examine your surroundings. Graveyard (on the dirt) You are in a graveyard. You can tell, see, because of the graves. They lie before you, headstones and crosses in little white rows. The moon casts feeble illumination over the scene, throwing deep shadows in all directions.

You'll never forget the last time you kissed him: at the funeral, in his coffin. the material of his shirt, the stillness of his chest, the deathly pallor of his skin--dry, and cold as ice.

The denial that flooded through you, followed by the dull emptiness of the space that opened up in you, and everyone who knew him. You remember his parents, your friends, huddled close around his casket. God, how horrible... You can't help but wonder--did he know? In those last few minutes, when he felt control slipping from him, did he realize that his time had come? Was he afraid? And what does he know now that we do not? Did he feel pain? Does it haunt him every day of his spiritual life, as the memory of his passing haunts those he left behind? You can't look anymore. God fucking dammit, what is this? Is this some sort of purgatory? Are you dead, now, and this is what it's like? Or is this just another dream? You're sick of it. Absolutely, utterly, sick to fucking death of dreams. Others call you the rock, the emotional center of their universe. How can that be possible when you can't even begin to reconcile with your own past? What makes you so special that the images, sensations, pain, and emotions all stay with you, even to this day? You'd think you'd work through it, get past it, but no. That would be normal. Expected. The right way for things to happen. Marcus gives you a cold look as the weight of all that's happened to you sinks in again. "Now do you understand?" he asks, quietly.

Marcus gives you a dry look. "There's always a first time for everything." You start to smile. And then, it happens. There is a rush of wind that almost knocks you down--Marcus, looking behind you, sees it first and his eyes become as wide as dinner plates. You whip around to find out what's happening--and come face to face with the likes of something you have never before witnessed in any of your worst nightmares. For a frightening few moments your brain refuses to let you see what's right in front of your eyes clearly, however, it comes into focus soon enough. The thing's green-and-yellow skin is stretched taught over a collection of moving parts that look like they've been slapped together by a God gone mad. You can see things--ranging from gray tumorous growths to unidentifiable red streaks that glisten wetly--sliding around underneath the skin. It stands on six legs, making it look like a giant squatting insect. Each leg terminates with a long, silvery, wicked-looking prong that glints in the moonlight with what must be poison. Acidic-looking drool falls from the creature's open mouth filled with teeth as sharp as needles. It exhales, forcing you to step back and cough--it's as if the vapor actively seeks to burn out your lungs. The creature looks ill at ease on the ground, seeming more accustomed to flying with the huge jet-black wings sticking straight out from it's sides, flapping slowly and powerfully. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this thing, however, is that there appear to be no eyes on its face, and yet it is most definitely staring straight at you. Marcus lets out a yell that is mixed parts anguish and frustration. "Of course! Of course, just as soon as I start thinking about it it fucking comes back! Do you see, Kristen? Do you see what I have to deal with!" [ACTION] look

"I won't ask if you think I should stop because I already know the answer." He sighs. "I guess I've just never bothered to care before. I mean, what's the point? You don't do a lot when you're dead. Oh, sure, you can spy on all those nubile young ladies in the shower whenever you want but that just really gets old after a few years, you know? That was a joke, by the way. It never got old."

You start to whip around but the hand does that for you, bringing you face to pouchy, fat face with your father. "Well," he says, cold eyes boring into your face with an unmistakable air of malevolence. "Well... well well." He looks you up and down, taking in the disheveled state of your clothes; the dirt you've tracked all over the church floor. He just sighs. "You know, I miss the old days. They knew how to handle uppity women back then. I wouldn't have to deal with this kind of disrespect then, I'd just black your eye. But now I gotta tiptoe through the goddamn tulips else y'all start screaming 'He hit me! Raape! Domestic assaauult! Aaaaahh!' and I gotta dip into my retirement funds to get lawyers and blow through court dates and skip town and it's just such a stupid waste of time. Ah, time. We all have such a limited amount of time. Do you see what I am saying, Kristen?" "Get your FUCKING hands off me you *cretin*--" "Temper, temper, child," his face growls. His grip increases, your shoulder crying out in pain. You aim a sidehand chop at his arm; under normal circumstances you're quite certain it would have broken his wrist, but it doesn't seem to have fazed him. "This is a dangerous place. You can die, and there won't even be any carrion to come 'round to strip your bones. Not even the worms will love you. So watch your step, or you'll find yourself back in a 6-foot hole like your doped-up fag friend back there." He shakes his head. "Fine fucking company for my daughter to associate with. So that she can become... Just. Like. THEM." He spits with disgust. "We've tried. You know? We really did. But you just wouldn't have any of it. So off you go." Quick as a flash, his hand lets go of your shoulder to whip towards your face; you lean back to avoid the devastating punch you're sure is coming to break your nose, and his fist closes over your chin. His fingers are like iron; his horse-like face is brought an inch from yours as he hisses at you to open your mouth. You grit your teeth; he slaps you across the face. His strength wins out over your will; his other hand comes out and forces a pill down your throat. You gag with all your might, but it's no good. He releases you, backing up a few steps, wiping off his hands on his robes as if ridding himself of a particularly unseemly form of vermin. You always thought he'd make a great name for himself as a preacher, and damned if he doesn't look the part now. Amazing the things that run through your mind at times like these. As bad as you usually feel for putting him in the hospital, right now you can't think of anything other than how much you wish you'd finished the job. "That's better, Missy. This'll fix you right up. Now get out of here. You're a Cymbalta child now... Not mine." His words echo into the near distances, feeling as if they're traveling a thousand miles to drop into your head. Your father's face morphs into the face on the Christ statue, creating some sort of unwholesome amalgamation, lamps raining fire down upon you as the world turns away. Inside your mind, you hear the church bell... hell's bell... school bell? Oh, right. The bell to end first period, it rang right before everything really went to shit.

[ACTION] shoot creature [STATE] Oh hell yes you are shooting that goddamn thing. You raise the gun to your shoulder, don't bother sighting, and squeeze the trigger; the bullet leaves the barrel at approximately holy wow that's really fast speed and scores a solid hit directly on the creature. And then glances off, speeding away into the night. There's an almost Looney Tunes-esque moment where you look down at your gun, just to check and make sure that there isn't a flag sticking out of the end of the barrel reading "bang!" (with all of the insanity that's happened so far it honestly would not surprise you at all.) The creature does, however, turn around from its dogged pursuing of Marcus--and looks at you. You start to wonder if there was any point in climbing out of that grave, to begin with. The creature slowly but surely advances towards you, and then stops. It takes you a moment to realize why: it's standing in front of the hole you climbed out of, the dirt still shifting uneasily. You can't see any sort of expression mass over its triangular face but it appears to be considering the best way to pass this obstacle. [ACTION] marcus, west

Looking paler and more terrified than he ever has in his life, he slowly, too slowly walks closer to the thing--and then he looks at you, and a sudden warm light of both understanding and resolve fills his eyes. He charges the thing like a football player and barrels straight into it broadside. The creature, blindsided, still makes no noise even as it lurches sideways, tries to retain its balance, and in the process puts all of its weight on exactly the wrong leg. The unstable hole breaks open; the creature comes very close to seriously injuring both you and Marcus as it flails desperately for balance. There is none to be had, however, as the hole keeps collapsing, sending the creature helplessly further down into what was just a few short minutes ago your own grave. Wordlessly, you and Marcus both get busy with the dirt; shoveling it in handfuls, filling the hole as best you can. You don't stop even after the ground is even, you don't stop until there is a mound of solid-packed dirt that's almost up to your knees. Then you just stand, exhausted, looking at each other as if not quite sure what to do next. Then, quietly, he looks into your eyes and utters the one word you've wanted to hear from him for so long: "thanks." You nod, silently, unable to speak, tears silently filling your eyes. Marcus gives you a slow salute, and then turns around, walking slowly away from you toward the church; soon he is lost in the darkness. [ACTION] look

[ACTION] south [STATE] As you step towards the exit, a hand shoots out of a pool of shadow cast by the lamplight beneath the door and seizes one of your shoulders in a vice-like grip. You start to whip around but the hand does that for you, bringing you face to pouchy, fat face with your father. "Well," he says, cold eyes boring into your face with an unmistakable air of malevolence. "Well... well well." He looks you up and down, taking in the disheveled state of your clothes; the dirt you've tracked all over the church floor. He just sighs. "You know, I miss the old days. They knew how to handle uppity women back then. I wouldn't have to deal with this kind of disrespect then, I'd just black your eye. But now I gotta tiptoe through the goddamn tulips else y'all start screaming 'He hit me! Raape! Domestic assaauult! Aaaaahh!' and I gotta dip into my retirement funds to get lawyers and blow through court dates and skip town and it's just such a stupid waste of time. Ah, time. We all have such a limited amount of time. Do you see what I am saying, Kristen?" "Get your FUCKING hands off me you *cretin*--" "Temper, temper, child," his face growls. His grip increases, your shoulder crying out in pain. You aim a sidehand chop at his arm; under normal circumstances you're quite certain it would have broken his wrist, but it doesn't seem to have fazed him. "This is a dangerous place. You can die, and there won't even be any carrion to come 'round to strip your bones. Not even the worms will love you. So watch your step, or you'll find yourself back in a 6-foot hole like your doped-up fag friend back there." He shakes his head. "Fine fucking company for my daughter to associate with. So that she can become... Just. Like. THEM." He spits with disgust. "We've tried. You know? We really did. But you just wouldn't have any of it. So off you go." Quick as a flash, his hand lets go of your shoulder to whip towards your face; you lean back to avoid the devastating punch you're sure is coming to break your nose, and his fist closes over your chin. His fingers are like iron; his horse-like face is brought an inch from yours as he hisses at you to open your mouth. You grit your teeth; he slaps you across the face. His strength wins out over your will; his other hand comes out and forces a pill down your throat. You gag with all your might, but it's no good. He releases you, backing up a few steps, wiping off his hands on his robes as if ridding himself of a particularly unseemly form of vermin. You always thought he'd make a great name for himself as a preacher, and damned if he doesn't look the part now. Amazing the things that run through your mind at times like these. As bad as you usually feel for putting him in the hospital, right now you can't think of anything other than how much you wish you'd finished the job. "That's better, Missy. This'll fix you right up. Now get out of here. You're a Cymbalta child now... Not mine." His words echo into the near distances, feeling as if they're traveling a thousand miles to drop into your head. Your father's face morphs into the face on the Christ statue, creating some sort of unwholesome amalgamation, lamps raining fire down upon you as the world turns away. Inside your mind, you hear the church bell... hell's bell... school bell? Oh, right. The bell to end first period, it rang right before everything really went to shit.
