[STATE]  Observatory Room At least fifty meters wide, this semi-circular room must have been the observatory lounge for the inhabitants' spare time. A set of tables and seats form a theater of sorts, for tonight's show of the universe. A glass dome, covering all the south side of the room and part of the ceiling, is open to the stars. The high corridor is to the northwest, while a second, tighter tunnel departs from the northeast. In the northern wall, a metal ladder heads up into an opening. A segment of the dome has been retracted. Through it the supernova looks far brighter. The intense light is just barely suffocated by the jumpsuit's dark sunshade. The dome itself looks more shiny. Through it the warmth of the supernova reaches the interior of the room with great strength. You can feel the warmth reaching inside the jumpsuit. The supernova radiation starts powering the bar. The supernova flare starts heating the bar. After a few seconds, the immense power of the devouring supernova charges the bar to its full potential.
