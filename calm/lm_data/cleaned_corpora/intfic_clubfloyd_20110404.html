The Chinese Room argument is a thought experiment originally devised by John Searle, designed to answer the question (in the negative): "Can a computer ever understand language?" Imagine a computer that has so complete a set of rules for providing Chinese output to Chinese input that it behaves exactly as a human who understands Chinese would. Ask it a question in Chinese, and it will give an appropriate response in Chinese. It appears do "understand" Chinese. But does it? Imagine now a human living in a small room, who is given a book consisting of a vast set of rules for providing a response in Chinese characters for any information ey receive in Chinese characters. Like a computer ey will provide appropriate Chinese output to Chinese input. The person is analogous to a computer, but does the person understand Chinese? It would seem, intuitively, that ey don't. The meat of the argument here is to distinguish between syntax, the rules by which language is constructed and manipulated, and semantics, what language actually means, and then claim that even incredibly in-depth knowledge of syntax is not sufficient for semantics -- only human-type minds, and not an artificial intelligence, have the capability to understand meaning. This leads into the debate about what "meaning" actually means. What can it be that only human-type minds have? What makes us special? Some philosophers, including, perhaps, the creators of the world you now find yourself in, would argue that actually all that the mind's ability to respond to input actually comprises is an incredibly complex set of learned syntactical rules, and that "meaning" separate from this is illusory -- so that if one were to learn all the rules for Chinese language-manipulation, one would understand that language.

Reaching down to undo her handiwork, you find that, with near invisible speed, she has jumped onto your aching nose and nutted you right between the eyes. You fall back with a resigned oof. "I did warn you now," says the scarecrow. "I reckon it's safe for you to untie those shoes, now, Anjeline." As you get gingerly to your feet, you catch a flash of Anjeline's underskirts as she scrambles up the scarecrow's pole and into his stuffing.

[STATE] You're not going to be able to go south just yet, not while Anjeline's eyeing you suspiciously from under the scarecrow's hat. [ACTION] north [STATE] You walk along the road towards the village. It's only a short distance, but this direct and precise road makes it seem like quite a trek, with the sight of the village always straight ahead of you, getting bigger by excruciating degrees. Eventually, though, you reach the first few village houses. Yellow-thatched and cross-timbered, they cluster around the road like groups of schoolchildren on a picnic day. And, indeed, there are children playing games outside, -- the girls in pink blouses and the boys in blue britches -- laughing and clapping and throwing hoops at each other. You try not to listen to the actual words of the games which, where children are concerned, you find, tend to be more truly horrifying than anything the best gothic authors could dream up. Something strange, you realise, has happened to the road. Without you noticing, it's switched from that black tarmac to a rutted country cartway. Then, looking up at the buildings as you walk further into the village, you see no more quaint cross-timbering but rather -- a modern pavement caf?? A bar, the word "drink" etched in fashionable lower-case letters on the window glass? Looking down, you see the road has changed again into a paved street. Looking up -- there's a maid in a peasant blouse pulling at a water pump! The bar has become a ramshackle country tavern! Blink. A medieval market village. Blink. A modern cosmpolitan town. Blink. Both at once? Your mind can't fix on a single image of the village. It seems to be every different thing at once, as and when needed. The maid, now in a crisp business suit, carries her wooden water pail into a barber shop, whose red and white striped pole sticks straight out of a dry stone wall. A man in peasant garb emerges from a building with the words "Cartesian Theatre" emblazoned above the door in neon letters. And the church's spire oscillates between a stone tower, a verdigris spire, and a concrete minaret. You shake your head furiously, as if this will make reality fix itself. You feel terribly ill. Village Street A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their various changing forms clutter around, entrances facing out onto what seems (most of the time) to be an ordinary village street. Passers-by duck in and out of the buildings, stop by the water pump, or carry on to a square to the north.

[STATE] Inside the Mill Sheilding your face from the fire and smoke, and momentarily questioning your sanity as you do so, you push your way through the door into the windmill. Wooden beams are crashing down around you in arcs of flame as you search for the source of the screams. Then you see them, trapped behind some arcane grinding machinery -- a huge man dressed in robes and an archbishop's mitre, and a small woman in a French maid's uniform. You pick your way through the burning wreckage in an effort to reach them, and then you pull back in horror. Just as you realise that the man is the Archbishop of Cambray, instantly recognisable from his regular appearances in the pages of The Guardian, so too do you realise that the woman is -- your mother. Her screaming and his bellowing snap you back to the urgency of the situation. The mill is crashing round about you and you have just time to enact a daring rescue. But with mounting horror you realise that you can't possibly carry both of them at once -- indeed, you may only be able to rescue one of them. But who? [ACTION] rescue mother [STATE] Grabbing her left leg, you drag your mother heroically from the burning mill. As soon as she is clear of the building it explodes in a melodramatic and highly implausible inferno, from which rolls, rather pitifully, the Archbishop's mitre.

Plato's Cave The lantern's dim glow casts shadows across the walls of the cavern, which, oddly, seems not so much collossal as contrived. Raising the lantern, you read an etching over the eastern entrance to the cave: "Property of Plato." Casting it around, you notice a gap in the walls of the cavern that leads down further into the cave system. Chained down in the centre of the room, eyes affixed on your shadow playing on the wall, are the denizens of this cave. You make a bunny shadow-picture for them.

The day turns to night and then to day and back at ever-increasing speeds. After about eighteen thousand, two hundred and fifty flashes you arrive in the past. Around you appears to be a night-darkened museum exhibition. A clock on the wall, its hands simulacra of keys, indicates the time (or perhaps the simulacrum of time) to be  9:58. Given that the time machine doesn't seem to move spatially, the Ivory Tower must have been the International House of Keys some fifty years previously, or so the banner on the wall suggests. In the centre of the exhibition is a case displaying a key loaned by the H.G. Wells Reenactment Society. It has the number "2" engraved on it. With your axe to hand, you smash the case and grab the key. Immediately a heinous wailing fills the room, and lights flash in burning red -- the alarms have been set off! A security guard rushes in and rugby-tackles you. In defense you lash out with the axe, and to your horror the guard's head separates from his shoulders in a graceful arc of blood. The severed head, carried forward by its own momentum, smacks you in the chops -- and your horror is compounded by the fact that you immediately recognise -- though younger than you knew him -- your own grandfather.

Otherwise -- another door lies on the other side of the chamber. But there is another machine between you and that door.

Immediately the room is filled with an extraordinarily bright light pouring forth from the box, which is quaking in your grasp. You cast it to the ground, and it skids along the ivory towards the Demon, showering sparks in all directions. You look up at the Demon's stricken face -- he is gasping, his eyes bulging -- he is clawing himself away from the burning light. You shield your eyes from the sight, but you can still hear his hellish bellows -- they echo round the chamber, growing louder and louder, and all you can hear is the noise and the light is burning through your eyelids . . .
