[STATE] Undying Garden Spring's blossoms and budding trees are here in profusion. Your lantern gives the chamber a quality of sharp angles at odds with the careful arrangements. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain. A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch. Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward. [ACTION] west [STATE] Skeletal Banquet It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. South lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward. On the table is a banquet of bones. [ACTION] down

[ACTION] down [STATE] The lantern behind you brightens as you approach the stairs, anchoring a path for you through the sea of stars. Hall of Hawks You see silhouettes out of the corner of your eye: blade, hand, a woman's hair floating long and free; they elude any attempt to view them directly, as though they ceased to dance across the walls when you do so. Hawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open to the wind and warmth, unobstructed except by your presence. Stairs of darkest marble circle upward. A passageway leads south into clear, colorless light. [ACTION] break mask

[ACTION] south [STATE] Hall of Doors At first, this place of polished surfaces seems like a profusion of mirrors and a kaleidoscope of doors. Looking more closely, though, all doors are one, save the one you came from. The peculiar translucence of the walls suggests that it is growing light out. Northward, a passageway no longer riven by shadow returns to the rest of the tower; across from it stands a door to the south. [ACTION] south

In particular, one of the fragments is from my short story "Alas, Lirette," in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, January 2001. Chalk it down to a moment of hubris. Plus, it amused me.
