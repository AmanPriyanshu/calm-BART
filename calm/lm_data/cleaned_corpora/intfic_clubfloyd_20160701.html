[STATE]  I've known strange people, but fighting a viewing table? [ACTION] touch table [STATE]  You touch the table and are instantly transported to another place! Sacrificial Altar This is the interior of a huge temple of primitive construction. A few flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over the altar, which is still drenched with the blood of human sacrifice. Behind the altar is an enormous statue of a demon which seems to reach towards you with dripping fangs and razor-sharp talons. A low noise begins behind you, and you turn to see hundreds of hunched and hairy shapes. A guttural chant issues from their throats. Near you stands a figure draped in a robe of deepest black, brandishing a huge sword. The chant grows louder as the robed figure approaches the altar. The large figure spots you and approaches menacingly. He reaches into his cloak and pulls out a great, glowing dagger. He pulls you onto the altar, and with a murmur of approval from the throng, he slices you neatly across your abdomen. ****  You have died  **** You find yourself deep within the earth in a barren prison cell. Outside the iron-barred window, you can see a great, fiery pit. Flames leap up and very nearly sear your flesh. After a while, footfalls can be heard in the distance, then closer and closer.... The door swings open, and in walks an old man. He is dressed simply in a hood and cloak, wearing a few simple jewels, carrying something under one arm, and leaning on a wooden staff. A single key, as if to a massive prison cell, hangs from his belt. He raises the staff toward you and you hear him speak, as if in a dream: "I await you, though your journey be long and full of peril. Go then, and let me not wait long!" You feel some great power well up inside you and you fall to the floor. The next moment, you are awakening, as if from a deep slumber. Endless Stair You are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail. There is a lamp here. [ACTION] look

[STATE]  Technology Museum This is a large hall which hosted the technological exhibits of the Great Underground Empire. A door to the south is open. A strange grey machine, shaped somewhat like a clothes dryer, is on one side of the room. On the other side of the hall is a powerful-looking black machine, a tight tangle of wires, pipes, and motors. A plaque is mounted near the door. The writing is faded, however, and cannot be made out clearly. The two machines seem to be in bad shape, rusting in many spots. Directly in front of you is a large golden machine, which has a seat with a console in front. On the console is a single button and a dial connected to a three-digit display which reads 900. The machine is suprisingly shiny and shows few signs of age. [ACTION] get in gold [STATE]  TURN DIAL TO 775 The dial is set to 775. [ACTION] push button
