Railways You are standing by the bay of the railways, where trains arrive and depart. The light gets dimmer, here, but it is still strong enough to let you see the nearest surroundings. It then fades away in the intricate maze of the other platforms. A series of gates opens north into the main hall of South Fork Station. Through the bars you can see hundreds of people passing by, like ants in a sand castle. A deep sense of claustrophobia gets to your nerves as you stare at the long tunnels winding everywhere from this place. The intricate maze carves so deep and so far that now it could easily count more surface than on the open air...

Aseptic walls run relentlessly for kilometers, along with a vast number of laboratories and facilities. These places are a sort of gigantic city-under-the-city, where the researchers and the workers spent their time together in a closed environment. Due to the extremely long times before resurfacing, many were captivated in the settlements for months until their duty schedule expired. The seclusion proved too much for the inhabitants of the settlements, who started showing signs of paranoia and of claustrophobia. After only three years since the first humans entered the vault, a fierce riot took the pale halls, leaving more than three hundred civilians dead. The settlements were closed and all the work was handed over to automated machines and robots. Only a part of the endless maze that once was the settlements is still visitable: the Museum of the Vaults, near the Central Station. There, visitors can witness the "magic" of the white corridors lighting system, some of the remaining labs (only a handful are still functioning -- even if for mere demonstrational purposes) and the thrilling experience of the disappearing walls.

Initiative One (or First initiative) All reunited, the Council of the Thirteen pledges eternal secrecy upon this Initiative, which will not be traded, in any part, at any cost. The icy mantle under Monarch (System KFS - Andromeda galaxy) has been pierced. What the first human probes have found can only be described as the remnants of a former civilization, the mortal spoils of which can be trusted as ultimately lost. A series of globular machines lays in a pattern (called the Hyeromatrix), hidden under the very mantle of the earth. All forty-four of those machines (called the Hyerotropes) are dormant but still present a form of "living" electromagnetic and geo-gravitational power. Beyond this, an unknown energy array seems to be pulsing inside them, out of the usual spectrum. Whatever the structures are, there is indeed no way of stating that they aren't alien in nature. Moreso, the radiance emitted by one of the bigger spheres is very similar to the fast decaying fingerprints of the Event residue. This MUST be noted as extremely important. As the coded memories recount, the Event Primeval was a star-shattering event that devoured entirely our neighbor galaxy. An energy pattern so similar could mean the Event can be replicated -- or even controlled and slaved to one's benefit. The Andromeda colony came here from outer space many centuries before the Event happened. We now have time to study and understand how the Event started, to avoid this New Heaven being destroyed by forces as of now uncontrollable. For this reason, a containment cage will be closed around the forty-four Hyerotropes and investigative labs will be built under the Monarch's crust. By order of the Council of the Thirteen, the cage will be named "Construct" and the labs "the Settlements".

[STATE]  ENTER 237 ON TERMINAL You type the number into terminal, and the screen wakes up. What follows sends frigid whiplashes through your spine. Initiative One (or First initiative) All reunited, the Council of the Thirteen pledges eternal secrecy upon this Initiative, which will not be traded, in any part, at any cost. The icy mantle under Monarch (System KFS - Andromeda galaxy) has been pierced. What the first human probes have found can only be described as the remnants of a former civilization, the mortal spoils of which can be trusted as ultimately lost. A series of globular machines lays in a pattern (called the Hyeromatrix), hidden under the very mantle of the earth. All forty-four of those machines (called the Hyerotropes) are dormant but still present a form of "living" electromagnetic and geo-gravitational power. Beyond this, an unknown energy array seems to be pulsing inside them, out of the usual spectrum. Whatever the structures are, there is indeed no way of stating that they aren't alien in nature. Moreso, the radiance emitted by one of the bigger spheres is very similar to the fast decaying fingerprints of the Event residue. This MUST be noted as extremely important. As the coded memories recount, the Event Primeval was a star-shattering event that devoured entirely our neighbor galaxy. An energy pattern so similar could mean the Event can be replicated -- or even controlled and slaved to one's benefit. The Andromeda colony came here from outer space many centuries before the Event happened. We now have time to study and understand how the Event started, to avoid this New Heaven being destroyed by forces as of now uncontrollable. For this reason, a containment cage will be closed around the forty-four Hyerotropes and investigative labs will be built under the Monarch's crust. By order of the Council of the Thirteen, the cage will be named "Construct" and the labs "the Settlements". For obvious secrecy reasons, the real motives behind the two buildings will be concealed from the population. Monarch Bastion Satellite, 12/05/8199.

Report to the Council about the discoveries around the Alpha Radiation by Ektor Mastiff & Andy Re's What we have here may be, thus far, the most important discovery in human recent history, if not on a bigger scale. Upon scanning the recently exposed areas underneath the University basement (after the last minor quakes that interested the area) our team found a new kind of radiation -- from now on called "Alpha Radiation" (AR) -- springing from a single spot under the second and third layers of crust. That means beyond the icy layer, too. This radiation, the kind of which has never been measured before, has been fast growing in the last few weeks, reaching a point where it cannot be further ignored by the scientific committee. The latest of our discoveries stated without any shadow of a doubt that something enormous is at stake. It was Dr. Re's that first linked the strange spectrum to the residual fingerprint of the Event energy burst, that "background noise" that still plagues the Andromeda dark matter gravitational pull, with the one relative to the AR. As noted by the scientific crew, the Event residue is what is forcing the galaxy to shrink, due to its connection with potentials yet unknown which raise the mass of the galaxy itself to the point where the universe's eternal expansion is stopped and reversed. Now it looks like a similar energy is growing under our city, less than three kilometers below the surface. What we suggest is a deep scan -- and maybe a human driven probe -- in the interested area in order to find out what's happening down there. The volcanic crust separating what was once the glacial layer from the lower halls cannot possibly be thick enough to hold those energies at bay. Nor can it be trusted to keep a region larger than one third of Monarch's surface hidden from whatever it is that rests down there. In my humble opinion, the chances that former colonizations could have gotten in there before the glacial age (trapped? self-defending?) are quite high, especially now that we have discovered the Alpha-radiation. In the end, we know nothing about Monarch before the first settlements from the outer galaxies came into Andromeda more than one thousand years ago. Technology back then was not sufficient to dig as far as we have recently, and the glacial layer was only partially melted and covered by the constructs. I suggest further investigation before we start -- as we should -- to probe the source of the radiation. The evidence of structures unknown to the humans is too much to ignore. An example could be the existence of the Hyerotropes. These were more than once hinted at as some sort of alien machinery used for unknown purposes. A Hyerotrope -- or Gravitational Sphere -- is, indeed, an unknown artifact. We can only suppose they landed on Monarch before the glacial layer was made, as the seventeen specimens found all were under the icy layer or half protruding from it. The magnetic spectrum they emit is actually almost purely geo-gravitational, with small sparks of radio waves, and this suggests they were a sort of "anchor" for something bigger which needed to stop by the surface. Ultimate considerations about the Hyerotropes cannot be made, as no-one has yet succeeded in truly activating them.

[STATE]  When the world around finally falls, you take your time just to climb the glowing cube, and see what happens. Seconds later, the last fierce earthquake devours the world in a single gulp. A light so dense it can barely be endured fills the Hyerotrope and the dome starts breathing as if it was alive. Then, you are caught by the sensation of being pulled downwards, like a drunk man in an elevator... Report to the Council about the discoveries around the Alpha Radiation by Ektor Mastiff & Andy Re's What we have here may be, thus far, the most important discovery in human recent history, if not on a bigger scale. Upon scanning the recently exposed areas underneath the University basement (after the last minor quakes that interested the area) our team found a new kind of radiation -- from now on called "Alpha Radiation" (AR) -- springing from a single spot under the second and third layers of crust. That means beyond the icy layer, too. This radiation, the kind of which has never been measured before, has been fast growing in the last few weeks, reaching a point where it cannot be further ignored by the scientific committee. The latest of our discoveries stated without any shadow of a doubt that something enormous is at stake. It was Dr. Re's that first linked the strange spectrum to the residual fingerprint of the Event energy burst, that "background noise" that still plagues the Andromeda dark matter gravitational pull, with the one relative to the AR. As noted by the scientific crew, the Event residue is what is forcing the galaxy to shrink, due to its connection with potentials yet unknown which raise the mass of the galaxy itself to the point where the universe's eternal expansion is stopped and reversed. Now it looks like a similar energy is growing under our city, less than three kilometers below the surface. What we suggest is a deep scan -- and maybe a human driven probe -- in the interested area in order to find out what's happening down there. The volcanic crust separating what was once the glacial layer from the lower halls cannot possibly be thick enough to hold those energies at bay. Nor can it be trusted to keep a region larger than one third of Monarch's surface hidden from whatever it is that rests down there. In my humble opinion, the chances that former colonizations could have gotten in there before the glacial age (trapped? self-defending?) are quite high, especially now that we have discovered the Alpha-radiation. In the end, we know nothing about Monarch before the first settlements from the outer galaxies came into Andromeda more than one thousand years ago. Technology back then was not sufficient to dig as far as we have recently, and the glacial layer was only partially melted and covered by the constructs. I suggest further investigation before we start -- as we should -- to probe the source of the radiation. The evidence of structures unknown to the humans is too much to ignore. An example could be the existence of the Hyerotropes. These were more than once hinted at as some sort of alien machinery used for unknown purposes. A Hyerotrope -- or Gravitational Sphere -- is, indeed, an unknown artifact. We can only suppose they landed on Monarch before the glacial layer was made, as the seventeen specimens found all were under the icy layer or half protruding from it. The magnetic spectrum they emit is actually almost purely geo-gravitational, with small sparks of radio waves, and this suggests they were a sort of "anchor" for something bigger which needed to stop by the surface. Ultimate considerations about the Hyerotropes cannot be made, as no-one has yet succeeded in truly activating them. Whatever the power source which keeps the Spheres "alive", it must still be there, and this is confirmed by the scattered energy ghosts that flow around their perfect structures. And then there is the Alpha Radiation. We cannot tell for sure if it started developing in the last weeks. We can only suppose it was -NOT- there before Dr. Re's and his scientific crew discovered it. And we can hope it is nothing to worry about. Still, hoping is not all we have to do.

[ACTION] read resume [STATE]  The results of the tests on the Hyerotropes are still fuzzy. In the end, at least, we understood how could our 'beacon' reach so far in such a relatively short time. Almost two millions parsecs in less than 400 years. That would mean traveling at least 6,250 times faster than light and, although certain velocities have been hypothesized, nothing we ever witnessed reached them. The Hyeromatrix works as an attractor. The energy spectrum of the whole matrix (as opposite to the single sphere's) is capable of bending the structure of the Higgs Bosom's pattern, articulating a fierce vacuum-like tunnel which can pull, evidently, from a very long distance. The Hyeromatrix must have sensed the 'beacon' and decided to make it its own. The single Hyerotropes have proven themselves 'thinking machines', if that is what we want to call them, or even living beings. Their scattered pattern in the underground of this cold planet is not coincidental and, contrarily, the matrix has the purpose to actually enhance the spheres' abilities and reach. They breathe, as a living being, and as a living being the pollute the atmosphere when doing so: The ethereal substance they grow is toxic to the surroundings as noted by research Omega-33. Ultimately, their presence indicates a superior meaning to the whole universe, one which we never thought of -- at least scientifically -- up to now. We can suppose the Hyerotropes being a species on their own, breaking the walls of human research on the matter quite abruptly.

[STATE]  The results of the tests on the Hyerotropes are still fuzzy. In the end, at least, we understood how could our 'beacon' reach so far in such a relatively short time. Almost two millions parsecs in less than 400 years. That would mean traveling at least 6,250 times faster than light and, although certain velocities have been hypothesized, nothing we ever witnessed reached them. The Hyeromatrix works as an attractor. The energy spectrum of the whole matrix (as opposite to the single sphere's) is capable of bending the structure of the Higgs Bosom's pattern, articulating a fierce vacuum-like tunnel which can pull, evidently, from a very long distance. The Hyeromatrix must have sensed the 'beacon' and decided to make it its own. The single Hyerotropes have proven themselves 'thinking machines', if that is what we want to call them, or even living beings. Their scattered pattern in the underground of this cold planet is not coincidental and, contrarily, the matrix has the purpose to actually enhance the spheres' abilities and reach. They breathe, as a living being, and as a living being the pollute the atmosphere when doing so: The ethereal substance they grow is toxic to the surroundings as noted by research Omega-33. Ultimately, their presence indicates a superior meaning to the whole universe, one which we never thought of -- at least scientifically -- up to now. We can suppose the Hyerotropes being a species on their own, breaking the walls of human research on the matter quite abruptly. Or we can hypothesize an even more powerful entity at work, somewhere, to operate those things.

[ACTION] wrong [STATE]  This game was not intended as a maniacally perfect scientific resource for space travel. That said, the author put so much effort in trying to make everything realistic. Apart from the obvious things that couldn't be (i.e. a train falling for a kilometer doesn't only crumple: it disintegrates) there is one which stood hidden until much too late. The 'beacon' has been pulled through space by the Hyerotropes. They made it fly at 6k times light-speed. If that's so... what about the humans? How could the First Colonists reach Andromeda WITHOUT such power and knowledge? Well, they couldn't. Given there is no Earth date in the game, one could argue that the voyage took a really huge amount of time and that the Colony indeed reached through space around -- what do you think? 10.000 a.D.? 100.000? Well, nope: Andromeda is 2.5 MILLIONS lightyears from Earth. At the speeds we can reach nowadays, the trip would have lasted around 90 BILLIONS years. The one solution can be the use of a wormhole, a rip in the fabrics of reality that creates a passage to distant places... but we all know that would have been a deus ex machina. That's why it is not mentioned ingame.
