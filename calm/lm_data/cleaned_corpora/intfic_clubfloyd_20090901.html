Sky Pavilion Impossible. This is one of the exhibits in the Peace Gardens downtown, just outside of the city . . . but it doesn't exist anymore. They tore the entire neighbourhood down four or five months ago, after it burned to the ground. Someone's cigarette, right in this pavilion, I think, or maybe it turned out to be arson after all; either way, it was big news at the time. And yet, here it is, much colder here than back home. There's a sheer precipice just north of this pavilion, and the panoramic view of the city and the river has always been---always used to be---to our city what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris.

"The gallery is all I had---it's everything I've worked for, since I was eighteen---" He pauses, taking a deep breath. "Listen.

Also, Leo took me by surprise; never a good idea. We were sitting in my living room, just as always, and was saying something about how he'd tried answering someone's personal advertisement in the paper and it had gone flamingly badly; he was upset because the woman thought he'd misrepresented his age. Fairly standard Leo existential angst, in fact. "I used to want to go as long as possible without settling down," he finished, "because from what I could see most people in relationships spent half their time wanting out; I didn't realise that once I was permanently single I'd be spending most of my time wanting in." "I've already decided to be an old spinster," I said. "For the common good, really. Someone needs to break down the stereotype that we're all genteel, ancient ladies with thousands of cats." "You don't need to put such a bright face on it," he said. "Not with me. You must be so lonely." On any other day I would have been furious with this bit of effrontery, but on this particular day as it happens he wasn't so far off. "Sometimes." "More than that." "Sometimes," I said firmly. "More than sometimes. For me, anyway. What's the good of voluntarily staying on your own when are people out there who'd be willing to link their lives with yours, if only you'd ask? There's not enough time left to justify wasting any of it away longing out windows." "That's true," I said, and in truth it was exactly what I'd been thinking earlier that afternoon. "But if the right person doesn't come, he doesn't come." "Will you marry me?" I was shocked, even though in retrospect he must have had this entire conversation mapped out in advance. But more than that I was repulsed that he would act like this was such a casual act, arising from convenience, or better yet from jealousy, fear that I might default to someone else. And the fact that he had the ring all ready made it ten thousand times worse. Did he really think it would be that easy? He must have bought it on his way back from his disastrous little date, a thousand-pound ego boost in a little box. Pathetic, really. But at the time I felt nothing but fury. "Put that away, Leo." "Listen a second before you decide: this ring---" My voice did not break, I'm relieved to say. Instead I stood up and said, "You'd better go."

"How can they have done this?" I said, several times. "How can our elected officials so depraved as to destroy a work of art that belongs to half a million people?" "It's for the greater good, Matilda. Gardens can be rebuilt. We're alive. We're healthy. Besides, we still have the painting." "If you burn the gardens, quarantine or not, you're destroying the soul of the city." "That's silly, Matilda. Cities are soulless to begin with; it's only the people who matter. All you're saying is that you won't be content until you have a city where everyone is educated, affluent, happy, safe, and healthy." "Don't mock me. You find me stupidly idealistic to ask for our government to stop committing arson upon our own cities? Maybe it is possible for everyone to be educated, healthy . . . all five." "Will we?" He paused for a moment. "What if you had to choose four out of five? Or what if the entire city could be all those things, at the expense of a one person who had to undergo unimaginable tortures? Would you live there?" "Of course not." "Really?" He leaned back in his chair. "I would." "You wouldn't," I replied. "The idea just appeals to your sense of irony." "Well, for 499,999 people there would be no difference." I lost my patience then. "Leo, that's idiotic; of course there's a difference. What if you were the one person who had to die?" He shrugged.

[STATE] I open Leo's bedroom door. Vacant Room This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south. Leo stands here, looking healthy but frazzled. A familiar snapping sound comes from the hallway. "What I really don't understand," Leo continues,  "and you don't have to explain if you'd rather not---is how you got the diamond ring. I'd recognise it anywhere, but it can't be mine, because I've got it right here." He waves his own, snapping it on and off a few times for good measure. "I can only imagine Irene must have given it to you, but I can't imagine why." [ACTION] wait [STATE] Half a minute or so goes by. He sinks slowly to the floor. "Christ, Matilda, I don't know what to do. I find my key after thinking it was lost forever, but my gallery is gone unless I can find that damn key. And now I can't find Irene anywhere." Leo bursts into the room, waving the pocketwatch cord about violently. He looks desperate, more frightened than I can ever recall seeing him. "Matilda, where's the glass key gone? It should be in the music box, with the other keys, but it isn't there. Without it I can't get into the gallery." [ACTION] wait

I walk clean into another world, not even pausing to look behind me after I arrive. Cliff's Edge I am momentarily disoriented as my head fills with the roar of water. I open my eyes to mist, positioned by a cliff which comes to a point some distance ahead of me. The vista beyond the cliff is dominated by the waterfall, unnaturally close behind, so near that it's utterly impossible to see anything beyond it. Up at the far edge is Leo, leaning dangerously over the falls. "Leo!" I shout. But of course he can't hear me with the water as loud as it is. He's drawn these falls from his imagination, and they are far larger than anything I can conceive of in the real world, the water falling from a point far above our heads, and dissolving into mist far below, the cloud of mist so large it becomes impossible to see anything in the distance---there is only water, me, Leo and a line of small yellow flowers that seems to be thriving in the mist off the falls. I begin running toward him. "Leo! Wait for me!" But my voice seems to be unable to carry. And, then, suddenly, a bell rings overhead. I continue to run, the motion slower and slower, but now I am perplexed. As it rings again, I am hit by a rush of utter horror. "Oh, no," I say dizzily.
