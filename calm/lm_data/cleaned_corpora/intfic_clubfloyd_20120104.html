[STATE]  [ACTION] list h [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. The Tattoo Parlor I'm in a tattoo parlor, getting the Zork logo inked on my forearm, in order to get more screen time for the "GET LAMP" documentary. Jason Scott is here, grinning like the Sentient Demon Sun on the day mankind slowly discerns that there has always been a second, sentient, demon sun. He switched the original "Zork" logo the artist was using for reference with the one from Zork III when the guy was self-administrating a body shot. I'm no stranger to drinking on the job, but the artist pooled the booze in the  "o" of his self-stenciled "MOM" tattoo before lighting it on fire. So I'm sufficiently distracted to where I don't realize that the guy is painfully drawing in extra Roman numerals until it's too late. Scott's filming the whole thing, panning up to my grimacing. The Zork logo is made up of a bunch of little rocks, and the surface area for the extra ones is greater than that of a big batch of Safeway-Brand discount popcorn chicken. I can't even remember why "being on film" was so important to me, except that I wanted more exposure than Kent Tessman, CM, that smug bastard. Scott had a deal for me: First, help him break into Adam Thornton's second home in Canada, so we can film ourselves torching the place in order to dramatize the ending of Trinity. And secondly, be the subject for "the tattoo scene" to show how crazy text game fans are. I'd get featured in seven extra clips by doing all this. "How many clips am I in now?" I asked. I'm fucking shrewd, just look at me. If it were like four or something, well, I'm no fool. Four clips is enough to splice together a Youtube video with and get some thoughtful comments, maybe even some that don't bash women, wets or Jews. "This many," he said, holding up a copy of Zork Zero with his hand over the "Zork" part. Fuck! __________ [ACTION] examine jason

He had driven out from Wisconsin. I'm not actually that great with geography, so if that's impossible because of the Thousand Lakes or the precipice of a gaping chasm, then I guess he took a ferry. He bought hookers for the interview in an attempt to relax me beforehand, but one of them was scorching hot and looked like a girl I never got in high school, so I kept messing up what I was trying to say and making everything worse. Plus, it all took place in my basement, which is pretty much just an old oriental rug and nine Mr. Do! cabinets in various states of disuse. The one gal I was trying to get the phone number of was down to pasties and heels when there was a knock on the door. Normally that doesn't happen that much because 1) I live like a disgusting orc at the bottom of a spider-pit and 2) I have a self-styled moat around the house, consisting of that week's curry oil, a kraken and old Monster Energy Drink cans that I "recycle" back into the "environment" by my lonesome. "Who is it?" I bellowed. I hoped that taking charge of the situation would impress the girl I liked, but she was a hooker. Without even answering, five guys from the Lyons Pinball Team came downstairs. I recognized them instantly: the Jerk Who Monopolizes the Fireball Machine, the Bastard Who Monopolizes the Orbitor 1 machine, the Whoreson Who Monopolizes the Twilight Zone Machine and two guys who constantly play grabass near the bill change machine. "Who the fuck are these guys?" I asked Scott anyway. "Got my fingers in a lot of pies," he said, while at the same time knuckle-deep into the one called Chillaxxx. After a little while it registered to him that, no, seriously, I wanted to know what those guys were doing here. "I'm filming them after you, and I needed to consolidate some things.

I was actually racking up a substantial bill on this excursion. I usually bribe the border guard when I travel to Canada, since I am too repulsive to just be let into most NATO countries without a lot of paperwork, bother and disapprovingly clucked tongues. But more people means more bribing. "I haven't bribed this many people since I played Exodus: Ultima III." It's not a text game reference, so Scott doesn't acknowledge it. Which is fair, because I rarely got satisfying replies from anyone in that game. That's where the comparisons really end, though, because at no point in Exodus did Dupre or Chuckles tell you that every time they travel to Canada, they're consumed by the desire to snuff out a handful of lives. "Not just any humans," Scott says. "It's Canadians I specifically loathe, which is why I'm letting you work out your little dominance issues with Tessman on my dime." I attempt to interrupt, in order to remind him who bribed whom, when he shuts me up by hinting at a scrap of a story that features Steve Meretzky, my idol. But he goes back to talking about his true passion: killing off animals. "But you know how, if you are really into cake but can't have it, you might take up smoking?" I'm hypnotized by this point by the idea that I might get an untold tidbit from Planetfall, so I just sort of go along with it all. I tell him 'sure.' "It's the same thing with me. I come from a long line of famous Scotts, who bagged the big game. Tigers, lions, blue whales, probably a Rakasha in there, too, for all I know. Well, it just so happens that it's illegal to film yourself killing animal after animal, using the stuff I have in that bag." He makes a dismissive wanking noise. He then points to the bag on the floor in front of me. "Could you get me the lens in there." He doesn't phrase it as a question. [ACTION] look in bag

I usually do this sort of thing at work, when one of my co-workers starts talking about Java. I don't mind programming in Java, but I can't stand to hear other people talk about it. This creates a few problems for me that I end up having to hear about at my yearly performance review. After confirming that he's not going to launch into a Meretzky story any time soon, I let my mind wander. When did it go all wrong? It occurs to me that it went all wrong when I let the hookers in, so it's a pretty quick self-reflection. Thornton's house is to the north.

With the way this trip is going, I might suddenly learn that he can turn himself into a gun, all like Galvatron but with Scourge's goatee. He starts listing off voltages and I do the right-hand rule a couple times to mime like I am following along. I usually do this sort of thing at work, when one of my co-workers starts talking about Java. I don't mind programming in Java, but I can't stand to hear other people talk about it. This creates a few problems for me that I end up having to hear about at my yearly performance review. After confirming that he's not going to launch into a Meretzky story any time soon, I let my mind wander. When did it go all wrong? It occurs to me that it went all wrong when I let the hookers in, so it's a pretty quick self-reflection. Thornton's house is to the north. I'm not just saying that because I think everything in Canada is north of each other. [ACTION] transform into galvatron [STATE] You don't need to use the word "transform". [ACTION] north

"I actually do want to interview Thornton for this 'documentary'," sneers Scott, as we get into the right ZIP code, or whatever they use in Canada. "I'm just trying to think of a way to do it where we kill everything in his house afterwards." He scrunches up his forehead and nose in mild, distracted thought. "Well, you know, as an experienced text gamer, I am trained in creative problem solving. You want to get some good sound bites out of the guy, but no more than seven, because otherwise I made a horrible mistake. I -- " "I didn't agree to that," he snaps. "You'll get your seven; if I have to feed you the lines you'll get them. But Thornton has a talent for eloquent descriptions." "Come on, what makes you think Thornton will be able to slur seven words together, much less provide seven quality clips? He's a hard-drinking, dazzlingly original Missouri classicist who sweats some kind of bathtub gin/Herradura mix out of every pore in his body. He's also telepathically bonded to at least one of his dogs, like E.T. and Elliot, so the one he named Golem gets shit-faced out its gourd as he does." "You're really obsessed about clip length," says Scott. "Look, if I don't make it out of here and something independently horrible happens to like seven other guys involved with this project, it will be up to you and Jon Blask to release this thing.

"I want you to imagine a cross between a puma and a panther." I have a documented problem visualizing genetic monstrosities, so I just nod. "Okay, this cat has gone forth and killed reams of livestock all across Canada. It throws down chickens like a pack of orange Tic-Tacs. It even eats the common predators up there, like, I dunno, mongooses and wolverines." I start to suspect that Scott is one of those guys who don't actually know a lot about the nation of Canada, like 1) Americans who think that Toronto is a quick drive from Calgary, and 2) the entirety of the QuÃ©bÃ©cois. "The Beast is completely out of control, but nobody will do anything for two reasons. The first is the tax credit dispersed to the locals when half their stock goes missing, the second is because they all want to skull-fuck it." He clears his throat. "Although the thing is described as a puma crossed with a panther, I don't think that does it justice. You might be thinking of a four-legged beast, or some odd amalgam of the two distinct beasts, if you're some kind of thick-browed goddamn sped. You have to eliminate that First World mindset." I'm, of course, freezing my testicles off in a Saints jersey, undershirt, work boots, pince-nez and little else, involved in some kind of amateur poaching/arson operation that's being filmed for posterity. Aside from introducing some trouble with malaria and voting, I can't feel any less First World. "It's actually a woman, and it has a great body." Scott turns to look me in the eye for the first time since Edmonton. He searches for any trace that I might think this is some sort of anthropomorphic animal/fetish thing. "Great rack," he continues. "Fangs, of course, but who isn't into that? Certainly not the kind of people that would live up here in this frozen wasteland. Sleek, athletic legs... and she kills prey for her food and all that. She's an unbelievably sexy creature of mythology, and we're going to get her on film when she's passed out at Thornton's." "Wait... you know that she's here? How? How do you know these things?" "How did I know that Don Woods killed a dragon with his bare hands and then blogged about it in Willie Crowther's FORTRAN game, dummy? I just do. We're going to get into Thornton's place under the guise of interviewing him and then scour his place once he passes out and his eyes are liquor-scented 'XXX's. We'll film the Beast of Exmoor and then burn the place to the ground, killing everyone inside." My heart skips a beat, as Thornton has a really nice Atari trackball on his MAME system. Maybe I've become as inhuman as everyone else in my life. Maybe I just love trackballs. Probably both. He gives me the key so we can get in. I'm sure I'll lose it soon. [ACTION] light match

He had actually met me twice before, but he's so booze-fueled, I doubt he'd be able to spell my name if I spotted him both 'B's. "Can I get you two something to drink?" Before we can even say anything, he's taken us to his second bathtub. "There are few rules here," he says. "Don't bathe in the second through sixth bathtub. Don't ask questions about what I'm brewing or have brewed in those bathtubs." He walks us out to the MAME cab. "Lastly, all these games are yours to play and set high scores on, except one," he says. "Boon-ga Boon-ga?" I ask. "What? No. Major Havoc. Don't fuck with it - I don't have my roller set right, and I don't want to go digging back there to reset the score if one of you degenerates gets a high score with the arrow keys." There aren't any arrow keys on a MAME cabinet, but I'm temporarily blind after smelling the bathtub concoction, and Scott's focused on looking for the Beast. I try to soak in some of the craftsmanship of the table: it's divided into four sections - each player gets his own joystick, six cherry microswitch buttons, a martini holder and a bolted-on cigarette tray. "Why don't you," whispers Scott, "distract him while I try to flush out the Beast." By the end of it he's not whispering any more, because he got a good glance at Thornton's eyeballs, which look like twin, bloodshot magnets of a like charge, both trying to escape his skull in opposite directions. "In fact," he says to me directly in front of Thornton, "Why don't you go into the other room with him while I look for the Beast so we can burn this place down." "OK," I say. "OK," says Thornton. Thornton takes me over to the MAME cab and wipes his chin with the back of his arm. He had somehow consumed a fifth of something in the brief seconds I was listening to Scott. "It'sh my pride and joy, you know," he slurs. "It's the most important thing I have ever contributed to the world." "It's a quality machine, definitely," I say as I spin through the front-end software, looking for the one game he said I couldn't play. I need help. "No, thish homebrew," he says while one of his knees gives out, and at first I think he means some text game he crammed into MAMEWah before realizing, no, he was talking booze-homebrew. "The cat-girl is good too," he says. I'm slightly surprised that he has any clue that there is a creature of myth reportedly hanging around his place. The house door is just as loud as the rest of the house. It looks like someone murdered a kilt on it. [ACTION] play game

"Did you find anything?" yells Scott from upstairs.

"Open the coin door," she says, all sexy. I can't, though. "It's locked." That's all the opening the Beast needed. She wasn't actually in the MAME machine's monitor, it was just a combination of her reflection and my fucked-up vision, thanks to smelling all the homebrew. The Beast of Exmoor drives its fangs into the back of my neck, and I instantly make a mess out of my shorts. I slump down against the MAME machine, smearing blood all over it. "Jason....!" I attempt to yell his name, to warn him. "scott, scott," says the Beast, mimicking the Loud Room from Zork I, but kind of messing it up. I raise a finger to correct her, but am in such poor condition that my held possessions instead scatter around on the ground. "My wife!" exclaims Thornton, as he bursts into tears. "My sweet, feral wife... why must you kill again, you know it drives me to drink..." Jason Scott comes flying down the stairs, equipment in tow, camera trained on the Beast. "You!" he bellows to Mrs. Thornton, the Beast of Exmoor. "You're, you're -- " "Sated," she says, as she picks up the book of Frontalot matches from just beyond my reach and lights a cigarette. She blows out the match and discards it towards one of the hallways with a floor that is soaked with standing alcohol. The match re-ignites during its graceful arc, and everything gets loud and orange. __________ Outside the burning house I wake up and find myself within a melting snow drift, just out of range of the Thornton's place as it burns and crumbles. "This is great footage," says Scott, with his eye into the camera. "I see you're awake. I only saved you because I'll need you to bribe the authorities when they get here. Of course, we're so deep into the sphincter of Canada, it could take weeks." He tears into a hunk of MAME-seared elk flesh. "The fire burns off all the alcohol - and how! - so I don't mind using it as a giant campfire for cooking. I don't really drink; it balances out all the other negative stuff, in my opinion." I guess you can categorize blowing up somebody's home, killing a guy inside and exterminating a species that science doesn't know about as 'negative stuff.'

You're four, five years old at the most. In the memory you don't know where your Mom is; over talking to one of the other moms, perhaps. All the other kids are climbing around on a towering metal jungle gym. The fall wind is brisk, and the metal is cold to the touch. You can see her standing there, alone. Her blonde hair is in messy pigtails; her eyes, the bluest blue. "Wanna spin?" she asks, and without warning she throws her arms out like airplane wings and begins spinning in place.

"We've already heard them all," you say to her, but she doesn't seem to care. "Which one do you want? I Love Rock and Roll? We Will Rock You? The Devil Went Down to Georgia?" "We Will Rock You!" she says. Carefully you lift the record player's arm, remove the last record, pop the yellow, spiral adapter into the middle of the next 45, and place "We Will Rock You" down on to your cheap, plastic turntable. After a moment of crackling, those familiar drums kick in. Boom Boom Clap. Boom Boom Clap. As they do, She stands up and begins marching around the room, stomping and clapping. Stomp Stomp CLAP. Stomp Stomp CLAP. You follow her lead and soon the two of you are marching around your room in a circle. Stomp Stomp CLAP. Stomp Stomp CLAP! The two of you mumble your way through the verses, but really belt out the chorus. "WE, WILL, WE, WILL, ROCK YOU!" the two of you shout. When the guitar solo rolls around you pick up your tennis racket and nail the solo. Your fingers touch each string carefully and methodically as if you're actually playing the guitar. You hope she notices your attention to detail as you play the tennis racket more accurately than anyone ever has. As the song comes to an end the two of you collapse on my floor. Your leg brushes against hers. It feels nice. The two of you continue to laugh, lying on your backs and staring at the ceiling. You're still holding that dumb tennis racket.

No power windows back then, not for a broke high school student such as yourself, anyway. "How much further is it?" she asks. "It's right up here, right past this parking lot," you say -- at least you hope it is, never having actually been there before. Right past the parking lot is an unlit dirt road. Recent rains have turned the dirt path into muddy ruts, and you weren't expecting it to be this bad. Before you know it, your wheels are spinning. You whip the steering wheel back and forth, but it's no use. You're stuck. You turn the ignition off and get out of your car to assess the situation. "Listen," she says. "I can hear the falls!" Seeing your car stuck in six inches of mud has changed the mood, but there's nothing you can do about that now. You stare at the car, wondering how you're ever going to get it out of here. "C'mon!" she says, running up the dirt road. At the end of the road is a barbed-wire fence. You lift the top wire up and hold the bottom one down with your foot, allowing her to crawl through the opening. Once through she does the same for you. "It's getting louder," she says excitedly, and she's right. You can now plainly hear the rushing water. As the two of you walk past the last row of trees, you can finally see it -- a giant, natural waterfall. As you step into the opening your foot slips on the wet grass and you hit the ground hard. "God DAMN it," you shout, which makes her laugh. Once the sting from the fall wears off you notice you're lying in a big muddy hole. Still laughing, she plops down next to you and wipes the mud from your face. Then, without saying a word, she leans over and kisses you. You muster up all your courage. "Let's spend the night together," you say. "Let's spend the rest of our lives together," she says, and kisses you again. ... As soothing as the sound of the waterfall is, the rising sun finally wakes the two of you. Your car is exactly where you left it. "How about this," you suggest. "You get in the car and turn the wheels all the way to the right. I'll rock the car a bit to get things going. On the count of three, you hit the gas and shout "PUSH!" Then, I'll push. Sounds like a plan?" "Sounds like a plan," she says, taking her spot inside the car. You begin to rock the car as the two of you count together. One ... two ... three ... "PUSH!" [ACTION] push

You lunge for the console, both physically and remotely through your nanotides.  But with his super-human strength and reflexes, Hugor reacts faster, simultaneously sending out interference to block the signal from your implants and crossing the distance between himself and the console in a single jump to smash it to ruin with his arm. Hugor runs to the nearest port along the Sphere, covering the distance in moments.  You signal the docking system to deny him access to the cruiser bay, and the nearest automatons shuffle towards him, hemming him in.  He throws the robots out of his way and slams his scorched fist against the closed docking lift, but the reinforced alloy fails to yield even to his great strength.  He raises his hands, and a shimmering field appears before the lift.  The field expands horizontally toward the lift, which disappears in a burst of molten slag.  Several loyal automatons fall into the vortex, and are gone. The vortex disintegrates, and Hugor disappears through the hole he created.

[STATE] Time passes... Minfor places a spiny robotic creature onto your forehead.

Your consciousness is plunged into pure pain, and agony because the only reality. The pain diminishes slightly, and your ears discern hollow, lifeless words.

Let us see if death has any interesting effects." You are enveloped in more pain -- a clearly physical pain.  All over your body, you feel tiny creatures burrow into your flesh, consuming your organs. *** YOU HAVE DIED *** [ACTION] look
