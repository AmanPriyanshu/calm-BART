[STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. So here you are, alone, again, in this vast subterranean laboratory dug deep under the peaceful town of Lubbock, Texas. Christmas time, holidays for almost everyone but you and a few other slaves... Nah, heroes. Working for the government is nothing but a privilege to be cherished. You're sitting in a steel chair, watching a small TV. Sitting in a way only apes would be believed to be able to sit, but hey, boredom has killed your ability to keep your back straight a long time ago. Your favorite show, "You bet your life", is about to begin but you still have to run the safety check with the computer terminal, like you've been doing every hour since the beginning of your shift.
