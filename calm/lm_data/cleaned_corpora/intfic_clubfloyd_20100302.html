"That's mighty fine construction," notes Muddy, sounding less feisty now. "Mighty fine indeed." The coach rolls to a halt and a thick arm yanks you roughly from your seat. You land awkwardly in the rutted street, where the sheriff holds you in place with the heel of one boot. He yells to his men, "Bring the coach around back, we got to impound that evidence." You are shoved into the sheriff's office and then into a small holding cell. The deputy wakes with a start, whips his dusty boots off the desk and stands, tucking his shirt back into his pants. The sheriff gives him a brief, judgmental glance and offhandedly tosses an arrest warrant on the desk. He barks, "Jimbo, listen up. Picked up these two down near the train. A federal marshal will be coming for them at eight o'clock tomorrow morning. There's going to be a hanging!" The deputy nods slowly. The sheriff continues, "Please take care of our 'guests'. I got to head down to Wichita Falls to discuss my invention with some investors, so you is in charge." The deputy smiles until the sheriff adds, "Jimbo, don't screw up," as he heads out the door. Jail Cell Why are you not surprised to have landed right back in the hoosegow after another one of Muddy's dubious plans? Will you ever learn? How did it come to this? The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's office. A broken stool lies on the floor. Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm. In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence. [ACTION] inventory

[ACTION] look [STATE] Jail Cell The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's office. A broken stool lies on the floor. Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm. In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

[ACTION] pull vine [STATE] You yank on the wiry vine and it yanks back. It's too tough to break off. From outside the window, you hear the bulk of the plant rustling as it swings back and forth. Halfway between the door to the outside and your jail cell, the sheriff's invention percolates. The deputy pokes his head back in the office and remarks, "I've about had enough of you characters. You can stew in your own juices here. I got important things to do over yonder in the saloon. But I reckon I would be dairy licked to leave you jokers alone." The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the doorway, tempted by the dinner bell. The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog's bowl, and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office's strange-looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash. "This here's Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don't cross him." Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close, and drool drips from his toothless mouth. "Flash here's apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff's fancy steam contraption." The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. "If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, 'ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can hear that halfway across town, and if'n I do hear it, then you'll have to deal with me *and* Flash." The deputy gives Flash one last pat on the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon. [ACTION] give meat to flash

You're carrying a hunk of meat, a spur, a tin, a pamphlet, your pocketwatch, your hat, and a scrap of paper. You are wearing your right boot, left boot, pants, and overcoat.

Jail Cell The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's office. A broken stool lies on the floor. Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm. In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

The marshal dispatches two guards to search behind the office, and when they return with corroboration about the stolen silver, the marshal instructs his guards to restrain and disarm the sheriff, concluding, "So, now it is clear. The sheriff took advantage of the railway incident to rob the train's silver himself in order to finance the development of his invention into a business. He framed these two itinerant laborers to shift the blame. No wonder he wanted them killed so quickly." The marshal rips the gold star off Sheriff Cheney's shirt and instructs the guards, "Place Mr. Cheney behind bars."
