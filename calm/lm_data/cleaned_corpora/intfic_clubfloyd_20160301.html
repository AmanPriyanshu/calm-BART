[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] I wrote my review of Dreamland a few weeks back, and then I deleted the app and said I was done. But I can't stop thinking about it. Not because the ads keep showing up (though they do, and whoever voiced that Nexus ad, fuck you forever) but because it was just... so good. Until the bullshit ending. Now that I know I'm not alone (hello AIXeddit! thank you for the cloud payments, no hard feelings on the overload!) I decided it was time to do something about it. I deserved better than this.  You deserved better than this. Given the price of REME devkits, I can't get my hands on one, and it's not like I have my Oni license anyway. And I'm shit for drawing, you don't want me trying to animate this. But I did get my hands on some really oldschool tech called Inform 7, which you're reading right now. That's right - this is interactive. I used a text adventure to build the end of Dreamland, the way it should have been. This is the ending we all should have had. Roll tape. ...and roll tape means you should key space.  Space is the long key at the bottom with nothing on it. Before we get going, one more thing. Did you have the content-locked version for people under 30? Key Y if you had the content locked version, N if you had the unlocked version, anything else if you're being a dick (which will be ignored anyway). Be honest, kidlets!

If you're at my cloud, you know that already, but it's tripped all over AIXeddit now and I have no idea who's running it, so. (Enabled updates are the best.) If you haven't played Dreamland (by Wonderland's Alice) you should play it before playing this. I think Dreamland Revised is great, because I did the best I could, but it's also crammed full of spoilers. Here's my original review. ---------------------- Dreamland (Wonderland's Alice) This is some new VR/AR thing I looked at last month. The gimmick is it's a game that you play in your dreams. I found the concept intriguing, so I hooked up the ol" REM Enhancer and downloaded the game's app to it. At first, I couldn't tell if the game was working (REME and other dreamtechs can be pretty buggy), but a few days in, I started having the trippiest dreams. A woman, dressed all in white with no eyes, asks me if I have visited the "Quartzian Palace". Far off in the distance, I see a castle that glows in many colors, but the way there always seems to be blocked by a chasm. Over many nights I struggled to find a way there, sometimes through bizarre dangers, often through places of great and strange beauty, until one night, I finally managed to find a way into the palace… Aaaand it turns out the ending is some serious "Don't forget to drink your Ovaltine!" bullshit. Like, seriously. Watch it on Youtube if you don't believe me. It's such a shame, because the game was so cool up to that, but I honestly cannot recommend this game in good conscience thanks to that ending. I deleted the app off my REME the next day. I'm still getting ads in my sleep. Goddammit. ---------------------- So what you want to do is get across the chasm and STOP THERE. Do NOT use your Visage to pass the portcullis, do NOT go into the Quartzian Palace, that's what trips off the ads. Believe me you do not want that shit. Come back and play the REAL ending here.
