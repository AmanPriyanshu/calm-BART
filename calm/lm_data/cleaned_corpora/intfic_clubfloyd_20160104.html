Your new world in its infant form lies before you. You open your eyes, and they slowly adjust, returning to the world your body resides in. Slowly, a number of objects fade into view, archetypes summoned by this old world as building blocks and food for your new world. Vacuum, liquid, solid and gas lay before you. But there is something odd; each is encased in a thick shell of a different kind. The vacuum is encased in a crystalline bottle; the solid metals are contained in a thick treasure chest, like the one you used on the desert world; the argon gas is contained in an organic flask, made from some sort of dense wood; and the liquid toluene is in a tea kettle, like the one you used on your birth world.

The rift to your world pulses wildly inside of the heart, but the red tendrils restrain it. The red forces constrict your new world. Helpless, you watch through the rift as an enormous asteroid hurtles through the void and smashes into your planet, killing billions of creatures. [ACTION] crush heart [STATE]  You destroy the heart, and the red energy explodes around you in a violent red flash. As the light dims, you see the darkness around you crumbling and fading, until you are surrounded again by your familiar clouds. The red energy begins flowing into your new world at a quick pace. A crimson stream touches you, and images flash into your mind... An image of your first entrance into this world, opening a mighty machine and flying out. An image of you drowsily floating through the air, tickled by a zephyr of this world. An image of you careening through a black storm cloud, exhilarated by the joy and excitement of the dangerous gale. An image of you hesitating, turning away from both zephyr and whirlwind, drawn to inner contemplation. You begin to realize that this world has always been alive, and that in its own way, the world has loved you. You see a last series of images, of the world bringing the red ice to you, bringing the scroll and the ingredients it needed. Finally, you turn and see the blood of the world flowing into the next, strengthening it and making it real. Now you understand. This old world knew that the next could not live on its own. A sacrifice must be made; the old must die that the new may live. And only you could destroy the old world. Suddenly, a tremor runs through the area. Please press SPACE to continue. The wild sky stretches off forever in all directions. To the far east, storm clouds boil. To the west, the sky is gentle and open. To the far north, icebergs float amid the clouds. To the far south, patches of steam whirl in vortices. Far above you, the air becomes thinner near the top of the world. Far below you lies a blanket of thicker air. The air is warm and moist. The air is still and peaceful. You find yourself tired, your tentacles drooping. Any further west and you might fall asleep. The air pressure matches your natural buoyancy. The darkness clears, and you see the world around you again, slowly collapsing. Small bubbles float in the air around you. One bursts against you, misting your tentacles. The world, you realize, is kissing you goodbye. A bubble moves southwest, towards you. It bobs upward. It now lies slightly to the north and far to the east. Another bubble moves northwest, towards you. It sinks lower in the air. It now lies far to the east and above you. Another bubble moves southwest, towards you. It bobs upward. It now lies slightly to the north, to the east, and slightly below you. A pale green phosphorescent rain of tears fills the air. You cannot see the rift to your world, but you sense it near you. The world around you slowly decays, and you feel its energy flowing into you. [Your score has just gone up by two points.] [ACTION] go to rift
