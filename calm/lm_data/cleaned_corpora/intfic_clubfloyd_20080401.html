[STATE] Treasure Chamber This is one of the largest caverns you have ever been in.  The ceiling is forty feet up, and the walls are quite a ways away.  The ceiling is supported by massive pillars formed from stalactites and stalagmites. The phosphorescent moss that lines the walls provides a dim glow. Mysterious carvings have been left on one wall.  There is an opening to the east. In the center of the cave stands the object of your quest:  The massive, thirty-foot pedestal on which the legendary Toaster of Battle Creek has stood for centuries. On the massive pedestal is the Toaster of Battle Creek. You can see a rubber ball here. [ACTION] get ball [STATE] Taken. [ACTION] examine moss

You are engaged in a contest, a race across the galaxy to acquire the Toaster of Battle Creek Michigan (the last functioning toaster in the known universe, and therefore extremely valuable.) You like to win.  To ensure your success in this competition, you sabotaged the starships of the other participants.  Now you alone (or at least you and your faithful assistant Walter) have discovered the cavern of the Toaster.  Gloatingly, you ordered Walter to lower you into the cave... But your rope snapped, and now you're trapped here - perhaps forever... CHEATER An Annoying Adventure Copyright (c) 1996 by Wesley Osam.

Remember that really odd paragraph stating my eternal gratitude for the debugging verbs? I'm not actually that anal retentive; it was a hint.  If you look at the version listing, you'll notice the "D" that denotes that those debugging verbs are active.  Experiment with the ones I listed to find out what they do.  Once you've done that, the rest is simple. [ACTION] gonear toaster
