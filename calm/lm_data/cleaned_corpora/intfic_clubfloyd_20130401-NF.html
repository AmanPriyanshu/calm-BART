Act like a chowderhead and soon you will be percieved as one! "Now I will speak the word that will banish you from this land, the power of which can only be broken once your actions show that you have changed your ways!" He takes a deep breath. "POOTEMS!", he bellows in a very handsome manner while standing in a very handsome manor! Light retreats from the centre of the room as a wormhole rapidly takes shape. Count Dashing attempts to make a quick dash for freedom, only for an invisible force to pull him towards the now gigantic wormhole, its shimmering green hem caressing the ceiling. "I'll be back, Handsome!", the Count screams in defiance as the black abyss engulfs him, "I'll be back!" The wormhole vanishes, taking the villainous Count Dashing with it. Lord Handsome takes a moment to catch his breath before turning to you. "Oh, thank you! That cat got my tongue so long ago and I've been left speechless since, unable to say the magic words I possess that no other person in the land can say! I see my agents managed to retrieve it and send it off... how can I ever repay you?" He pauses briefly (and handsomely) to think. "Ah, I know! I'm sure your transport crashlanded here. Here, use my Jet Ski!" He brings out a single ski with a jet engine strapped to it with gigantic elastic bands. You fasten yourself in and (somehow safely) rocket home! *** You have won *** In that game you scored 360 out of a possible 360, in 369 turns, earning you the rank of Master Punster.

[STATE]  His eyes widen! He knocks Count Dashing to the floor with a great thud, snatches and opens the bag, and yanks out a cat! He thrusts his hand down the feline's maw, pulling out what appears to be a human tongue. In what is a rather repulsive display, Lord Handsome sticks the tongue in his own mouth and swivels it around until finally he speaks. "It was not I who did this to you, Dashing! You know as well as I that actions speak louder than words, no matter how powerful those words may be!", the Lord booms handsomely. "You did this to yourself by treating all around you poorly! Act like a chowderhead and soon you will be percieved as one!
