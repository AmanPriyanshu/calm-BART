He was glad that he'd decided to do this; that he'd decided to celebrate his sixtieth birthday by trekking through the Himilayas. His family had insisted on a surprise party, despite the fact that his doctor had warned them against giving him any sudden shocks.  Then again, his doctor had warned him against mountain climbing too.  But he wouldn't trade this for anything.  The view was splendid and stretched for miles, and it almost made him shake off the nagging feeling that he really should have been at that surprise party.  Sure, the family would be disappointed when he didn't show up, but they should have made a better effort to make sure that he wouldn't find out.  He wasn't stupid.  Leaving the guest list out where he could find it wasn't too clever for a start.  But that didn't really explain the feeling.  It wasn't guilt but rather something else.  Something he couldn't quite put his finger on. He pushed the feeling back again and looked into the sunshine, lifting his hands above his head.  He felt so alive!  He almost let out a cry of triumph, but stopped just in time.  There's no telling what might cause an avalanche in this part of the world.  Just then he heard a rush of wind behind him, he turned and... ...found himself staring at a skeletal horse, ridden by a tall, ghastly apparition of horror, who seemed to be reading a list... Lord Nigel McWorthington screamed at the top of his voice and gripped his chest.  The scream rebounded off the mountain walls and was suddenly silenced by an ominous rumbling sound from above.  He looked up at the avalanche descending rapidly, turned once again to the horrifying apparition and managed the words "You complete and utter..." before he was buried under a crushing weight of snow.

The tough, red brick did a good job of containing the blast from the exploded time machine.  The remains of said time machine sit in the centre of the cellar, nothing more than a twisted pile of metal and wires.  In one corner of the room is a stairwell, in the other a workbench and varied selection of tools and objects that look suspiciously mechanical. Exits: Up You can see Ernest Busset's shoe. Horse waits here, looking quite majestic.  Thomas Brewer stands here, looking around the cellar thoughtfully. "If this works we'll be famous!" chattered Ernest Busset, excitedly. "That's understating it slightly, Ernest." said Thomas Brewer, sardonically. "Just think of it, man!  Time travel!  We'll be...famous!" Ernest Busset could barely contain his excitement. "Are you sure this will work?  I'm not confident myself.  I know we've run through the figures a million times but...well, I've just got a bad feeling about this.  What if it doesn't work?" Thomas sounded very, very worried. "Nonsense!  This must work!  As you said yourself, we've gone through the figures a million times.  Now.  Stand back." Ernest sat himself into the contraption.  It looked like the cockpit of a glider, surrounded by a mass of wires and bits and pieces of metal.  Ernest fiddled with the controls in front of him.  They looked like they had been cobbled together from bits and pieces of old games consoles.  A digital readout flashed excitedly in front of his eyes. "Yes, yes.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  If you're so confident it will work then why are you telling me to 'stand back'?" Thomas did, however, take several large steps backwards as he said this. "Just in case!  Who knows what will happen?  Who knows if the field will be purely contained to the machine?  I wouldn't want you getting sucked back through time with me!  You need to stay here and document our success from this end!" Ernest was idly flipping a switch back and forth. "See, you're doing it again.  'Who knows what will happen?'  Is that supposed to inspire confidence?" "Just relax, old boy.  Think about what you're going to do when we are no longer constrained by time!  What will you do with this power?" "I'm going to go back in time and kill Hitler's parents." Thomas looked grim, his lips set in a firm line.  Ernest looked puzzled. "I wouldn't do that, old boy.  That sort of thing would just make Hitler really angry, wouldn't it?  I wouldn't have thought he was the sort of fellow you'd want to get on the bad side of." "No.  You've misunderstood." 'Again' Thomas added mentally, "I would kill them before he was born." "That doesn't make sense, man!  I mean, how can they be Hitler's parents until they have had a baby called Hitler?  Stands to reason!" said Ernest, cheerfully. "Never mind," Thomas muttered, "Look.  Be careful" he added, surprised at how much he meant it. "No problem!  Just watch this!" Ernest cheered, as he reached out and pushed a button. There was a whirring noise, which increased in intensity until it ended abruptly in a rather large explosion.  Thomas Brewer was thrown back against the far wall, and crumpled to a heap on the floor. He looked up from his prone position to see a tattered, charred shoe fall in front of him. "Oh dear." he said, with rather considerable constraint. He then climbed to his feet and turned to find you watching him from the other end of the room. "Oh dear oh dear." he trembles, "Look.  Just tell me.  Am I dead?" You gaze at the List. "Ith your name Ernetht Buthet?" you intone. Thomas Brewer looks at you blankly.  It's hard enough for a man to be on the verge of humanity's greatest scientific breakthrough and then to suddenly be confronted with the possibility that he might be dead, let alone to find that the Gatekeeper of the Afterlife has a speech impediment. "I'm sorry, did you say 'Erneth Buffet'?  Ummm...Do you mean Ernest Busset?" Thomas brushed himself down.  You nod irritably.  You've had a lisp for as long as you can remember and it's not your fault.  It certainly doesn't make your job any easier.  "No.  No.  I'm Thomas Brewer.  Ernest Busset is...oh.  Oh no!  Oh no!  Ernest is dead?" Thomas exclaims, shocked.  You nod again. "Where ith he then?" you ask, looking round the room in annoyance. Thomas grins and points at the charred heap of metal in the centre of the room. "I think the question really should be 'when is he?'  We built a time machine, he and I did.  And as there's no sign of a corpse I'm guessing that it worked!  It worked!  Do you realise what this means?" Thomas was jubilant, forgetting the situation for a moment. You shrug.  You personally suspect that it means that they won't be selling anything other than one-way tickets but you say nothing. "Ha!  He might have survived!  You can't know for certain!" You sigh.

He knew that he wouldn't have normally pulled this duty for six days in a row but recent events with the General's daughter had resulted in this sorry state of affairs.  He didn't regret a thing, but...this was really boring.  Nothing ever happened.  He was guarding a single door in the most heavily protected military faculty in the United States. He moved his rifle to the other shoulder and shrugged.  Maybe he should play The Game again.  His time on guard duty had been spent developing the rules to The Game.  It helped pass the time.  The Game involved him seeing how many times he could spin his rifle above his head in a minute.  It couldn't be any old spin, however, as the rules made quite clear.  The gun had to be held a certain distance above his head, at a certain angle.  The spin had to be at a certain velocity.

Maybe version 1.6 of The Game would see some major changes.  He didn't want a repeat of version 1.3, where he was very lucky not to have shot himself in the face. CRASH! Private Kline stopped in mid-thought.  What was that? CRUNCH! It sounded like it was coming from the storage cupboard just down the corridor. "I jutht trod in paint or thomething!" a muffled (but raised) voice sounded.  It was definitely coming from the storage cupboard. "Honethtly!  You could land anywhere in the whole building and you chooth to land in a cupboard!  Thtupid animal!" "Who's in there!" shouted Kline, his rifle raised.  The door opened and out stepped an incredibly tall and gaunt figure... ..You turn and see the young soldier with his gun raised. "Excuth me, but thouldn't you be pointing the other end at me?" you offer, helpfully.  You have no need to be afraid of firearms. Private Kline hurridly turns his rifle the right way round and looks at you, almost apologetically. "Identify yourself!" he barks. "Me?  I'm the Grim Reaper," you explain, checking The List, "And you wouldn't happen to be Thplong5b would you?" "Huh?  What?" Private Kline tried to compose himself.  He'd wanted some excitement, but this was a lot more confusing than he'd thought it would be. "No.  I gueth not.  You don't look like a Thplong5b.  I think I need to go through that door behind you." you look up from The List, certain that your Client is in the room that this soldier is guarding. "The door behind me?" Kline's resolve hardens, "No.  No I think not. I've got one job in this place - guard this door.  I don't care who you are.  You are not getting through." You sigh, but then look into Kline's face and realise that you've never come across a man with such single-minded determination before. Neither have you ever met someone with such total confidence that whatever he happens to face he can solve it with his gun.  Your own conviction wavers.  Most people, when faced with the Grim Reaper, simply give up.  This is new territory for you. As a creature formed and given shape by belief you begin to wonder if Kline's faith in his gun is so great that it might actually cause you a problem were you to try and force your way past him.  You're not certain, but neither are you prepared to take the risk.  You didn't get this far by taking risks.  This really is very annoying, but you're going to have to find a way past Private Kline. Corridor (Area 51, Nevada) A very plain military corridor, lacking any redeeming features.

Storage Cupboard (Area 51, Nevada) You are crammed, almost bent double, into a small storage cupboard. With your prefect night vision you can make out several shelves, crammed full of pots and bottles of various fluids.  There seems to be a definite cleaning theme to this cupboard.

Exits:  East You can see a shovel blade. Horse waits here, looking quite majestic. Private Kline yawned.  Guard duty was so unbelievably boring.  He knew that he wouldn't have normally pulled this duty for six days in a row but recent events with the General's daughter had resulted in this sorry state of affairs.  He didn't regret a thing, but...this was really boring.  Nothing ever happened.  He was guarding a single door in the most heavily protected military faculty in the United States. He moved his rifle to the other shoulder and shrugged.  Maybe he should play The Game again.  His time on guard duty had been spent developing the rules to The Game.  It helped pass the time.  The Game involved him seeing how many times he could spin his rifle above his head in a minute.  It couldn't be any old spin, however, as the rules made quite clear.  The gun had to be held a certain distance above his head, at a certain angle.  The spin had to be at a certain velocity. It was pretty complicated, which probably explained why - after five days - his personal best was only two.  The rules were being reviewed yet again.

Jimiyu Wangai sat at the table, a thoughtful look on his face.  He was dead.  He wasn't surprised by this - in fact he'd been fairly certain it was going to happen anytime soon.  He enjoyed being proved right. Well, he'd lived a long and full life but had no intention of giving it up quite yet.  His youngest granddaughter was getting married in two weeks and he had been looking forward to that for ages.  So he'd decided that he wasn't going to go, and had made arrangements accordingly.  It had been surprisingly easy to work out.  He'd found the answer in a book in a library in Nairobi.  He'd spent the past few weeks at this table, waiting.  Now he was nearly there.  He looked at the entrance to his hut... ...and as if right on cue, you stride in. "Jimiyu Wangai?" you ask Jimiyu laughs.  "Do you really need to ask?  Has anyone ever said, 'No.  That's someone else?'" You nod.  "They do.  It never workth." "I suppose not." Jimiyu laughs again.  You're torn between two emotions - gratitude that he has yet to point out that you have a lisp, and confusion.  Most people aren't really that happy to see you. You sigh.  Time to see what he's got up his sleeve. "Your time ith up, Jimiyu." "What's the rush?  Haven't we time for a quick game first..." Jimiyu's grin is really beginning to get on your nerves.  He gestures at the table in front of him.  You notice, for the first time, that he is sitting in front of a chess set. "Oh...bother," you mutter. It's the rules.  If they challenge you, you have to play.  If they win then you've got to leave them alone.  If you win they have to come quietly.  It's the rules.  The universe likes rules.  The problem is that you're not actually much good at chess.  It's never really been a problem before.  Most people don't even think of it, let alone being foresighted enough to make sure that they die sitting at a chess set. You possess a little more foresight however, and have a contingency plan.  You committed to memory a failsafe way of winning a chess match, an unbeatable strategy, a foolproof way to victory.  With just one potential flaw... "Bagthy being white then," you offer, trying not to sound too nervous. "Ha!  I'm sitting at the white pieces.  I'm going first.  You can play as the black pieces." "Oh...bother." you mutter again.  Your strategy all hinged on going first.  You knew that you should have asked Samuel Reshevsky more questions when you met him. "Come on.  I haven't got all day...oh wait.  I have." Jimiyu laughs again "I have two weeks actually!  My granddaughter is due to get married and I'm not missing it for anything - not even death." You don't have two weeks.

The elderly lady looks at you, nods and grins, as though you had just paid her a compliment.  This is usually how this particular exchange goes. After about a minute of awkward waiting a hand appears from the doorway of darkness clutching a large plastic dry cleaning bag.  The elderly lady takes the bag, squints at the attached ticket and finally passes the bag over the to the female customer.  She takes the dry cleaning, turns on her heels and marches out of the shop into the crowd.

Death hadn't been as unpleasant as she'd feared, but she would still rather cling on to life.  She knew where she was with life.  If there was one thing that Agathe had always been afraid of it was the unknown.  Well, perhaps afraid was too strong a word.  Agathe was loathe to admit that anything frightened her, but she was sufficiently troubled to be moved to action. It had cost her a lot to get to this stage, but she thought it would all be worth it if it worked.  She'd have done something that - as far as she knew - no-one had ever done before.  She'd have cheated death. Standing in the doorway was an impossibly tall and lanky figure, wreathed in black and as pale as boiled rice. "Come in," said Agathe... ..you enter the hotel room, bending to get through the door as you go. You give Agathe a nod out of professional courtesy and stride forward towards her.  She is still smiling.  You wish that people wouldn't do that.  It really unnerves you.  You are a few feet from the bed when THUD!  You stagger back, rubbing your nose. "Ouch!" you exclaim.  That hurt!  Gingerly, you reach out and find your hand pressing against some kind of invisible barrier. "It works!  Ha!" Agathe gives a delighted little squeal and claps her hands together.

"What the Dickenth ith thith?" you demand, gesturing at the floor. "Pardon?  I'm sorry?  What did you say?" Agathe screams, staring at you with wide mouth.  You stay silent, your face burning with embarrassment (or at least it would be if your body had the circulation and blood to perform such a function). "I demand to know what thi...what i...what you have done." "You have a lisp?" Agathe cackles, "Oh this is just wonderful!  It gets better and better!  Death has a lisp!  The Grim Reaper has a speech impediment!  How perfect!" "I haven't got all day, you know." "Is that your horse?" Agathe is leaning off the bed, peering through the doorway into the corridor outside, where Horse stands to attention.  You stay silent.  She'll explain eventually.  They always do.  When people think they've actually got one over you they can't help but crow about it. "You've got a proper skeletal horse.  That's amazing.  A skeletal steed.  Can you say that?  Skeletal steed.  Let me hear you say that." There is a glint in her eye. This is not going well.  In fact, you think that this is one of the the worst things that's ever happened to you, and you've got a long memory. "Well, I may as well tell you.  It took me long enough to find out about it, after all." Agathe shrugs "I've spent most of my time and not inconsiderable fortune trying to find out how to cheat you.  I built up a library of old, forgotten and - in at least two cases - forbidden books, pooling the knowledge of the centuries.  I pieced together in several tomes the answer.

"That's fine, Mr...Raper." she says. "Reaper." you correct her, "Grim Reaper." She looks at you for a second and then grabs a pen, with which she makes a note on the letter that you received.  She then slides you a form and the pen. "Please fill this in, Mr. Reaper." she smiles at you. You stare at the form for a minute.  It simply asks you to sign if you are happy with the terms and conditions.  The terms and conditions include graphic threats about what Blackbury Bank will do to you if you don't keep up with the card repayments, but seeing as pretty much all of the threats don't affect you (except possibly the one about the branding iron and the glue) you feel no reason to be concerned.

The bank clerk looks at you as though you're the crazy one and then taps away on her computer for a second.  A few minutes later she presents you with a credit card in your name.  She passes you the pen and the sign the back of the card, feeling a wave of pride in your new possession and statue as bank customer. "Thank you." you say, turning to leave. "Ah, Mr. Reaper?" the bank clerk waves her hand at you, "My pen?" "Ah, thorry." you respond meekly, returning her pen to her. [ACTION] examine clerk

Everything is made out of marble or some other very shiny rock.  In the distance you see large revolving doors leading out onto the streets of Paris and by the doors is a reception desk, manned by a person wearing a garish uniform seemingly pieced together from individual items salvaged from a fight between a cinema usher and an ice cream salesman.  A lot of people seem to be milling about aimlessly.  There is an archway to the south.  The only other way out of here is to press the button that summons the lift.

[STATE] You awkwardly clamber inside the time machine. Inside Time Machine (Area 51, Nevada) The time machine is clearly meant for someone a lot shorter than you. You feel like a pen in a matchbox.  From the outside the machine looked complicated, but from the inside the task of understanding what's going on is positively herculean.  You can see a large number of lights and dials, none of which you can understand.  It doesn't help that any instructions written in the machine are in some kind of alien dialect.  The things that you think might be significant are a digital readout which says '2007', the buttons next to this readout, an open panel revealing a mix of wires and a pile of paper which is chained to the inside of the machine, clearly to avoid theft.

"At least I saw my time machine work before I died," he reasons, "Not many men get to see the result of their life's work." "On the contrary," you state.  "Everyone theeth the rethulth of their life before they die." "Good point," says the ghost of Ernest, thoughtfully, as he vanishes before your eyes. Another soul reaped.  Another soul closer to finishing work. Sir Allan Jones looked at the document again and coughed nervously. "Um, yes, Lady McWorthington I have the final report on your husband's death right here.  It's been compiled from all of the evidence we found at the scene and...ummm...it makes for interesting reading.  I'm not sure if it would help for you to know what it says." "Please.  I have to know," says Lady McWorthington. "Well.  OK." Sir Allan Jones coughed again, wishing he could be anything other than the British diplomat to Nepal right now.  "We've constructed the last moments of your husband and it seems that...that...that he was climbing the mountain and had reached the pass.  And he died there." "I know this," Lady McWorthington is annoyed, "Tell me what happened!" "From what we can tell, he...he...appeared to have taken off his boots and socks and wondered around in bare, size fifteen feet.  Then...then a horse came along and stood for a while near him.  Then it appears that he put his socks and boots back on and there was an avalanche. Which killed your husband..." "Oh." Lady McWorthington gasps, "Wait.  What was that about his size fifteen feet?" "Ummm.  It doesn't quite finish there.  It appears that after that...he...he...he dug himself out of the snowdrift and then lay down again.  Errrrr.  So.  That's what happened." There is silence.  A clock ticks in the background.  Sir Allan coughs again and waits.  Suddenly Lady McWorthington breaks the silence. "Size fifteen feet?" Thomas Brewer sat in the office of the university, his palms sweating nervously.  Professor Johnson peered at him over the rim of his glasses. "You must understand that while we are all very sorry to hear about the death..." "He's simply missing at this point." Thomas stressed. "...death of Doctor Busset," stressed Johnson "I must insist that you return to the university and resume teaching.  This whole notion of a time machine must be put behind you." "It works!  I was there!  And so was..." Brewer stood and gestured wildly. "And so was who?" Professor Johnson sounded curious. "Ummm..." Thomas sat down again, remembering the tall stranger who had appeared at the cellar "Nobody.  No.  It was just me." "Hmmmm..." said Johnson, unconvinced "Still.  I must insist..." At that moment they were interrupted by a student barging into the office. "Professor Johnson!  Professor Johnson!  Quick!  Turn on the television!" the young man shouted, breathless. "What is the meaning of this?" Professor Johnson intoned. "Oh...let me!" the student stumbled across the room and flicked on the television sitting on a shelf.  The 'BBC' news logo flashed across the bottom of the screen along with the scrolling words BREAKING NEWS. The reported was speaking animatedly, his microphone shaking with barely contained excitement. "...the most amazing thing is, despite these human bones being over ten thousand years old, the fact that this man had glass ionomer cement fillings in his teeth!  Scientists are baffled by modern composite being found in ancient teeth and have refused to make any further comment at the moment - other than to confirm that the skeleton has been christened 'Ernest'..." Professor Johnson turned and simply stared at Thomas Brewer, who was grinning from ear to ear... "So how's it going?" the girl asked. "Pretty good.  Pretty good." the man replied, looking up from his laptop computer. "So what are you writing now?" the girl responded after a pause which suggested that she was going to have do all the work in this conversation. "I'm writing a guide to Battleships." the man didn't even look up from the screen. "What, like warships you mean?" "No, the game 'Battleships'.  Oh no!  You sunk my battleship.  That kind of thing." "Is there strategy for that game?  I thought it was just random guessing until you got lucky." the girl didn't really seem that interested. "Luck?" the man looked up from his computer for the first time in the conversation "Luck doesn't come into it.  It's all about the strategy. Do I pick this coordinate, do I pick that coordinate?  It's the ultimate game of cat and mouse." "That's what you said about chess when you were writing your chess guide," the girl objected, examining her fingernails. "So.  What's your point?" "Are you going to pretend that it's sponsored by the President again?" the girl looked out of the window. "What?  I never said it was sponsored by the President," the man seemed offended by the suggestion. "It's kind of misleading though.  You definitely imply that the President is behind your guides," the girl sounded disapproving. "It's all totally above board.  I'm not breaking any laws," said the man, who happened to be called George W. Bush. "Still, I suppose this one's different anyway," the girl looked at him. "Why?" the man had gone back to typing away. "At least you actually know the rules of 'Battleship'." "As long as people keep buying my guides, I'm happy baby," the man concluded, as he switched his laptop off. "One of your systems went off and contacted us." the fire officer explained again to the manager of the hotel. "A malfunction.  Nothing more." the manager assured the fireman, escorting him to the door.  This was not going so well.  It was only the sprinkler going off that had alerted him to the fact that one of his guests had died in the room.  It was going to take ages to clean up the mess and deal with this unfortunate incident.  And he had absolutely no clue why the corridor outside room 247 smelt of horses. "Can we at least check?" the fireman objected as he was pushed through the revolving door. "No need, I assure you." the manager grinned and waved at the firemen gathered outside the hotel.  One of them gave him a two-fingered wave back.  Passers-by were stopping to look at the fire engine.  The manager clicked his fingers and one of the staff came running. "I need you to clear up room 247." he barked. "...yes sir." said the staff member without much enthusiasm.  He had seen what had happened in room 247. "I'm going to call the police.  Ms. Laurent was a valued customer." he sounded almost sad, which he was - especially because the bit of Ms. Laurent that he valued most was her seemingly limitless credit card. "Yes sir." sighed the staff member, shuffling off to undertake the thankless task.  To think that he'd given up a promising career at McDonald's for this... The manager turned his attention back to the situation outside the hotel. "At least the sprinklers work." he mused, waving again to the firemen - who seemed to be arguing amongst themselves.  Honestly.  Who'd be a hotel manager? Victoria Salmon stood in front of the Major, inwardly seething. "There is no doubt that the uniform found was yours, Captain, and the papers - though a forgery - were very convincing." the Major was reading from a report. "Yes sir," snarled Salmon. "The papers seem to bear all the hallmarks of being a forgery by Agent Sunglasses and the uniform...you say that there was a mix-up at the dry cleaners?" "That's right sir." Salmon snapped. 'Well.  I think that the combination of uniform and papers would clearly have been enough to fool Private Kline - he's hardly the sharpest tool in the box, is he?" the Major chuckled.  Salmon said nothing. "So, I think that wraps it up.  It appears that nothing was sabotaged or stolen, so I assume that the only reason the spy was here was to find out what was in the autopsy room.  No surprise there - you can read all about what we're up to here on the Internet anyway can't you, Captain?" the Major smiled. "Yes sir." growled Victoria. "You're dismissed Captain.  Thank you for your time." Victoria Salmon didn't move.  The Major didn't notice for a minute or two, but he eventually did.  He looked up and read the look on Captain Salmon's face. "Is something wrong Captain?" he asked. "Sir.  I read Private Kline's report.  How could he think that it was me?" she fumed. "I thought we'd cleared that up, Captain.  The spy was in your uniform and with some convincing papers." 'It's not that sir.  His report..." she recalled from memory "...described the person he spoke to as a ghastly apparition from the pits of hell  Freakishly sized, terrifyingly pale and with the breath of a hellhound.  How can he confuse me with that?" The Major thought for a while. "Maybe he thought you'd forgotten to put your make-up on?" he ventured. Victoria Salmon screamed, turned on her heels and stormed out of the room.  The Major waited for a minute and then picked up the phone and made a call. "Yes, yes.  Hello.  Yes.  It's me.  Look - you need to be more careful.  You gave the papers to the wrong person it seems.  Yes. Yes.  No.  I managed to clear it all up.  OK.  Goodbye." the Major put the phone down.  Honestly, he had enough on his plate without clearing up other people's mess.  Who'd be a double agent? "There's no future in it," he muttered under his breath. You stare at the void outside, relaxing in your favourite armchair. In the background The Eagles are instructing you to Take it to the Limit One More Time.  You sigh.  Today has been an interesting day, no doubt about that, but not one that you'd wish to repeat. You slowly stand up and wander over to the bookcase, where you pull out your current diary and think about how to record today's events. You smile as you recall some of the situations that today brought you face-to-face with.  You suppose that it wasn't the worst day that you've ever had - not by a long shot - and it's only going to make tomorrow's jobs seem that bit easier.  The more you think about it, the more pride you feel in a job well done and the less and less terrible today seems to be.  You sit back down in the armchair and turn to a blank page. Life is good for Death.  Today has, all things considered, been a fine day for reaping. Thank you for playing. Congratulations! [ACTION] examine hourglass
