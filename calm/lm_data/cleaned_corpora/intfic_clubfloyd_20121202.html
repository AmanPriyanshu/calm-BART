The guy with the strange bangs and suit jacket is at the head of the table beside a goth girl who's too beautiful to look at directly. The table is laid out beautifully, a candelabra melting onto the white tablecloth, chipped plates trimmed with gold. Paula sits down at an empty chair and seats you beside her.

"They were out of--" He stops suddenly, seeing Max in the doorway with a bottle of wine in each hand. [ACTION] wait

She throws the bottle at him, and the last thing you see before you leave the room is the candelabra falling onto the tablecloth. In a rush you see the birds on the wallpaper, the front door still open, the flattened grass in front of you and before too long, you're back in your bedroom. You take off your clothes, trying to decide if they smell of smoke or just of guilt. You're in your bed when the fire sirens start to wail and the flames are becoming visible on the Manor. It's sad, but when you consider that the Manor was otherwise facing crowbars and rough hands and wrecking balls in the morning...  better a funeral pyre. *** A week, two weeks, three weeks pass.
