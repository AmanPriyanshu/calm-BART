There's a window above me leading to the room your body is in. There's farmland to the west, and Big Street is north. My hanging-out tree is here. Hey, egg.

[STATE]  Done! A mob of guardsmen charge out of the Watchtower towards the bank. I think I'll follow them. Bank Lobby Let me tell you, these walls gleam. They're made of Marmoreal marble, known for the gold lines running through it. The floors and ceilings are made of the same material. The lobby of the bank is fairly open. There are exits to the north and west leading outside, and the bank continues to the east. There's also a table with forms and stuff. There's a wanted poster on the wall by the table. There's a bored-looking man at the tables trying to fill out some forms. Three guards come rushing into the bank. "Stop right there, Two-Handed Bart!" shouts the tallest guard. "You're under arrest!" shouts the middle guard. "Wait! I don't think that's Two-Handed Bart!" cries the shortest guard. "But he's got the moustache and the scarf and the no hat. He looks just like him!" says the tallest guard. "Isn't he the same guy we didn't arrest last time?" says the short guard. "I don't think so. He looks exactly like Two-Handed Bart," says the middle guard. "Maybe you were just mistaken before." "I ... guess ..." says the short guard. "He does look just like the poster....Well, take him in. Good job, guys." The three guards drag the man out of the bank, while he wails incoherently about just being here for a loan. Heh heh heh. Time to go collect our reward money!

The main lobby is back to the west. There's a black cord running from a hole in the wall. There's a bored-looking teller behind the bars. Time for a delicious eggy snack! ...Oh crud.
