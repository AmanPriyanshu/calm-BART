[STATE]  Greenhouse The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die on a long plant bed. On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house. Hard green fruit bodies hang from the hayberry bush. The banberry shrub is crinkled and grey with mould. The plant bed is thick with spindleweed.

This slim volume tells of the downfall of a famous letter-beast in the Divergent Plains. The letter-beast laid claim to the Plains, marking out edges with his endless burgundy tail. Like all letter-beasts, he sublet his territory in exchange for victuals and favours. His downfall came by the cleaving points of the Knights Linear. The book describes their first encounter: "I will lease you all the land that you could possibly need, fair Knights, or I am not a letter-beast!" said the Red Letter, with sincerity uncommon in his kind. "We accept your word as it stands," said the Knights Linear evenly. But the Knights' need was great and in their attempts to halt the machinations of the Leminscaters they needed much land to grow lead groves. Soon all the land they'd let from the Red Letter had been filled and yet their lead rod requirements were nowhere near met. "What can I do for you, fine and fair knights?" asked the Red-Letter, smiling with all his sincere mouths and frowning with all his insincere mouths. "Letter-beast," said the Knights Linear, "our need is greater than the land that you have let us." The Red Letter opened his mouths for making deals and closed his mouths for making idle talk. "Even knights, I could easily let you more land for an appropriate price." "You misunderstand," said the Knights, "you said that you would lease us all the land that we could possibly need or you are not a letter-beast. Our need has outstripped the land that you have leased us, and yet you are still a letter-beast." And so, of course, the Knights Linear were entitled by their creed to undo any breakers of oaths. Upon that day they bisected the great beast and took all his land, evicting all other tenants and selling his great hide in millions of rectangular strips. Though the Knights Linear had merely acted justly, they gained the unearned favour of all other letter-beasts, who always rejoice when one of their kind is felled, and the unsurprising enmity of what was to become known as the Divergent Diaspora: a collective formed by many of the Red Letter's landless former tenants who mark their old landlord's demise each year with renewed vows to destroy the Knights Linear.

[STATE]  The Blue Rose Garden The Blue Rose Garden is comprised of a single rose bush grown to magnificent proportions. Its offshoots form a prickled boundary, enclosing the garden. At precise intervals, blue roses grow. From a rockery in the centre of the garden, from which all the offshoots stem, is the core bush and from it grows a pristine bouquet. The Destine mansion rises up to the west. A maze of flowers are reflected in the tooth-glass dome of the greenhouse, its sliding door almost completely flush with the unpanelled pane.

When you arrive you are who you once were, the Orloger, a theocrat with an obsolete role whose absence from the Chamber was surely not missed. You declare that you will be leading the next session to Assenter Cur who doesn't appear surprised at your sudden arrival. Within the hour you are standing before the Holy Chamber, dozens of theocrats" eyes upon you, the Confessor himself sitting in the centre. "Murder, pig-eating, heresy and usurpation," you begin. "These are the charges I level at Confessor Destine." A wave of shock ripples across the theocrats. You lay before your peers the seven deceits of Confessor Destine, each time raising your voice above the outraged cries of the crowd. Throughout, the Confessor remains silent, coldly assessing you. "But do not take my word," you say, "search the Destine mansion and there all the evidence you will find. "Search all you like, you will find nothing of the sort," the Confessor says with a slither of a smile. You suspect he discovered his home was broken into and took steps to conceal what might have been discovered. And right enough, no evidence of serious ill-doing was found although he had no time to procure a new llama and the rose cuttings taken turned white when grown elsewhere. While still the Confessor, all trust in Destine had eroded and a faction installed his absent grandfather the Doge as head of the clan. And as for you? Your position in the Theocracy is no longer tenable, sneakthieves are not untrusted no matter their motives. As they drive you out the chamber you cast your eyes across Sinua: if it takes seventeen more years, you will be back and back for good. ********************************************************************* *     _.-""""-._     *                         *     _.-""""-._     * *   .'          `.   *                         *   .'          `.   * *  /              \  *                         *  /              \  * * |    (o)  (o)    | *                         * |    (o)  (o)    | * * |       /\       | * And So It Will Again Be * |       /\       | * * |                | *                         * |                | * *  \    `-..-'    /  *                         *  \    `-..-'    /  * *   `._        _.'   *                         *   `._        _.'   * *      `-....-'      *                         *      `-....-'      * ********************************************************************* You achieved a subtlety score of 82% in 1229 turns, earning you the rank of Untrusted Theocrat.

[STATE] You step through the intersection and after a long walk through mud, you change your outfit in the next plain, and then again in the next, shedding cover identities like second skins as you move your way towards the centre of the plains: to the city of Sinua. When you arrive you are who you once were, the Orloger, a theocrat with an obsolete role whose absence from the Chamber was surely not missed. You declare that you will be leading the next session to Assenter Cur who doesn't appear surprised at your sudden arrival. Within the hour you are standing before the Holy Chamber, dozens of theocrats" eyes upon you, the Confessor himself sitting in the centre. "Murder, pig-eating, heresy and usurpation," you begin. "These are the charges I level at Confessor Destine." A wave of shock ripples across the theocrats. You lay before your peers the seven deceits of Confessor Destine, each time raising your voice above the outraged cries of the crowd. Throughout, the Confessor remains silent, coldly assessing you. "But do not take my word," you say, "search the Destine mansion and there all the evidence you will find. "Search all you like, you will find nothing of the sort," the Confessor says with a slither of a smile. You suspect he discovered his home was broken into and took steps to conceal what might have been discovered. And right enough, no evidence of serious ill-doing was found although he had no time to procure a new llama and the rose cuttings taken turned white when grown elsewhere. While still the Confessor, all trust in Destine had eroded and a faction installed his absent grandfather the Doge as head of the clan. And as for you? Your position in the Theocracy is no longer tenable, sneakthieves are not untrusted no matter their motives. As they drive you out the chamber you cast your eyes across Sinua: if it takes seventeen more years, you will be back and back for good. ********************************************************************* *     _.-""""-._     *                         *     _.-""""-._     * *   .'          `.   *                         *   .'          `.   * *  /              \  *                         *  /              \  * * |    (o)  (o)    | *                         * |    (o)  (o)    | * * |       /\       | * And So It Will Again Be * |       /\       | * * |                | *                         * |                | * *  \    `-..-'    /  *                         *  \    `-..-'    /  * *   `._        _.'   *                         *   `._        _.'   * *      `-....-'      *                         *      `-....-'      * ********************************************************************* You achieved a subtlety score of 82% in 1229 turns, earning you the rank of Untrusted Theocrat.
