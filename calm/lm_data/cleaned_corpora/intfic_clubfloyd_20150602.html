Tourists move down the steps toward Cabrillo Pavilion in long waves, unconsciously mimicking the ocean beyond. Yesenia loiters awkwardly at the sidewalk's edge and pretends to be fascinated by the fat little palm trees, the blue sign reading ZOO with its arrow, or anything else that will keep her face away from pedestrians. Yesenia turns at the distant roar of a bus. The familiar white body with its upper yellow stripe comes around the bend, and she reads 20 Carpinteria with relief. The crowd at the bus stop shuffles around, and Yesenia queues up to board, rolling the flowered suitcase behind her. 20 to Carpinteria It's like any other MTD bus: bluish-gray plastic seats crowded with passengers, huge windows, and an array of silver poles and black straps for standing passengers. No one's standing right now, though. The driver taps the fare box and gives Yesenia a meaningful look. Yesenia braces her suitcase against her leg. > I Yesenia digs hurriedly through her pockets and comes up with two crumpled singles. > PUT MONEY IN BOX Yesenia can't see any such thing. > PUT SINGLES IN BOX Yesenia flattens the two singles against the fare box and then feeds them into the machine. The fare box chimes its approval. The driver says, "No change," and points at the sign that says the same thing. Yesenia says, "That's fine," and she hefts her suitcase and moves further in so the next person can pay. There are still a few seats free: one at the front behind the driver (occupied by a newspaper), one in the middle across from the rear door, and one at the very back. > X NEWSPAPER It's a folded copy of the Santa Barbara News-Press. Yesenia could see the articles if she unfolds it. The last two passengers pay and board. > GET NEWSPAPER Yesenia picks up the folded newspaper. The bus pulls away from the curb. Yesenia shifts her weight to compensate and puts a hand on one of the silvery poles. > SIT IN BACK Yesenia takes the back seat. The bus picks up speed as it chugs along. > UNFOLD NEWSPAPER Yesenia unfolds the newspaper fully and holds it in front of her faceSince she's sitting in the back, she only has to angle her body and raise the newspaper to hide her face entirely. That worked out well. A portly man in his mid-forties opens up his iPad and starts listening to the news. Yesenia can tell that he's listening to the news because he's not using headphones, in clear violation of the bus policy sign. > READ NEWSPAPER Yesenia skims the newspaper, but she doesn't really want to read about the cleanup cost of the Santa Barbara oil spill. It's too depressing. The iPad says, "There was a disturbance today at the Santa Barbara Zoo, when a masked woman confronted a group of schoolchildren. KEYT reporter Vanessa Ellis is on the scene. Vanessa, over to you." Yesenia's heart drops like a brick. If there's footage.... The bus rumbles through a pothole. > TALK TO MAN Yesenia says, "Excuse me, would you mind turning that off?" The portly man frowns at her. "Yes, yes I would. It's a free country." The iPad says, "Thank you, Brandon! I'm at the Santa Barbara Zoo, where a group of schoolchildren were about to board their bus when a masked woman attempted to take them hostage." The bus slows down before entering a traffic circle. > TURN OFF IPAD It isn't something Yesenia can switch. The iPad says, "Witnesses describe the woman as five-five, dressed in white and lavender, with a crown of flowers in her hair.  The pending catastrophe was averted when a bystander engaged her in hand-to-hand combat, giving students and teachers a chance to escape." The bus swings majestically out onto Coast Village Road. > X ME Yesenia wonders how much of her is visible behind the newspaper. How much of this worry is paranoia? How much do they need to see, to recognize her? There are thousands of people in Santa Barbara with her build, her height, and her coloration - but none of the others happen to be on the bus just now. The iPad says, "One of the teachers, Katie Edwards, captured part of their encounter. We'll show you that footage now." The bus pulls to a stop in accordance with traffic regulations.

More than 44% of the coastline is now clear, thanks primarily to the efforts of regular volunteers." Yesenia sees her stop coming up, and she presses the yellow strip. The bus chimes and announces, "Stop requested." > Z Time passes. The iPad says, "When asked about the experience of working with her former nemesis, Manatee said...." but the bus rolls to a stop, and Yesenia misses the sound bite as she heads for the door. Yesenia hefts her suitcase down from the bus. It's about three minutes from the bus stop to her apartment, and she takes the distance briskly, stopping only once to shove windblown hair out of her eyes. About halfway there, she realizes that she doesn't have her purse. ¡Carajo! She tries to think back to when she last had it., and she realizes it must have been in the restaurant office. She'll have to ask Camilla for a ride once she gets home. There's an easy cut across the grass, but Yesenia takes the sidewalk instead, with the suitcase rolling along behind her. She rounds the corner of the building and starts up the front walk. Please press SPACE to continue. Tradewind Apartments - Front Walk A wide concrete walkway leads around the three-story building and up to the front door, flanked by ground lights on both sides, which shine in response to the setting sun. On the right, regimentally spaced palm trees provide an illusion of privacy for the west-facing windows. On the left, there's a parking lot for the apartment, but since the divider is all of six inches wide, the parked cars in the first row rest their noses against the walkway. Yesenia parks her suitcase beside the building's front door. There's a bank of resident mailboxes set into the outer wall, just to the right of the front door.

[ACTION] examine hyacinth [STATE] Yesenia can't see any such thing. > UNLOCK MAILBOX Yesenia reaches automatically for her mailbox key, but of course she doesn't have her keys. Because she doesn't have her purse. Because it's in the restaurant. But... she pauses to consider the angles of the sun. There's still sunlight touching the mailbox, which means she could open it with sufficient focus. And it wouldn't be the first time she's opened the mailbox without a key. > FOCUS ON MAILBOX Shielded from sight by the building and a palm tree, Yesenia stretches her awareness to the setting sun. The orange light warms her, just as it warms the mailbox. The sun has power over the mailbox; its heat can make the metal expand. Its absence can make the metal shrink. And she has power over.... Yesenia focuses. The tumblers click into the unlocked position, and she pulls it open. > GET ALL FROM MAILBOX Yesenia pulls the mail out of her mailbox. Among the advertisements and junk mail (promptly discarded into a convenient recycling bin), she discovers three white envelopes. > OPEN FIRST ENVELOPE According to the postmark, this envelope was mailed from Santa Barbara three days ago. Yesenia rips open the first envelope, revealing a letter. > OPEN SECOND ENVELOPE According to the postmark, this envelope was mailed from Santa Barbara two days ago. Yesenia rips open the second envelope, revealing a letter. > OPEN THIRD ENVELOPE According to the postmark, this envelope was mailed from Santa Barbara one day ago. Yesenia rips open the third envelope, revealing a letter. > READ FIRST LETTER (the first letter) Yesenia unfolds the first letter. It's typed in simple serif letters. We need to talk. Call me - and a number that Yesenia doesn't recognize. There's a 305 area code, though, and that's the Miami area. > READ SECOND LETTER (the second letter) Yesenia unfolds the second letter. It's typed in simple serif letters. I'm trying to help you. You don't have to hide from me. > READ THIRD LETTER (the third letter) As Yesenia unfolds the letter, a playing card falls to the ground. At the sight of it, Yesenia's stomach clenches, and goose bumps prickle across her shoulders. It's typed in simple serif letters. Call me, or I'm coming to see you. > GET CARD Yesenia picks up the playing card. > X CARD It's a standard playing card: paper coated with plastic, with a blue design on the back. Yesenia turns it over. As she expected, it's the Jack of Spades - which means the Jack of Shadows. Chris, she thinks, and glances around apprehensively. Is Chris already here? She always drives, because she hates the bus.... . > X CAR Yesenia scans the parking lot again, taking her time. She doesn't know what Chris is driving these days, but she knows it'll be a cut above the norm. And it is - a sleek, matte black car with a T-shaped logo on its nose, sitting three cars down and barely a centimeter off the walkway. The large black crystals hanging off the rearview mirror seal her suspicions. > KICK CAR (the sleek black car) Yesenia takes a deep, centering breath and then slams her foot into the black car's front bumper. She's reserving her strength; after all, there's no need to punt it across the parking lot, and there would be awkward questions if she did. The car launches an strenuous protest, flashing its lights wildly, shrilling an alarm, and honking its horn - not polite little beeps, but bewildered, angry blares. If Chris is anywhere around, that should get her attention. > G (the sleek black car) Yesenia considers kicking the pretty black car again, but she decides against it. Someone might see her do it, and the car is already upset enough. The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills for help. > Z Time passes. The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills for help. There's a sudden clatter from the apartment building, and then Chris explodes from within. Chris is tall and well-coiffed, as always, but her brown eyes are wide with rage, and if she has a perfect manicure today, it's concealed by her clenched fists. "What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing to my car?" "Getting your attention," Yesenia says. "It seems to have worked." (To speak with Chris, TALK TO CHRIS.) > FIGHT CHRIS Yesenia steps into Chris and then drops to execute a leg sweep. Chris ducks around the blow. Chris says in an aggrieved tone, "Knock it off!" The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills for help. > G Yesenia lunges for Chris and throws an elbow toward her face. Chris dodges sideways. Chris exclaims, "I didn't come here to fight!" The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills for help. > FIGHT CHRIS Yesenia pivots toward Chris and then drops to execute a leg sweep. Chris fends her off, though not without difficulty. Chris exclaims, "Knock it off!" The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills for help. > TALK TO CHRIS Yesenia says, "You need to leave. Now." Instead of answering, Chris glances west to the setting sun. It's so familiar a gesture that it makes Yesenia's heart ache, and for a second she even forgets what it means. But Chris is the Jack of Shadows.... The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills for help. > FOCUS ON CHRIS Yesenia reaches her mind toward the sun. It's setting rapidly, but there's still enough light... and she seizes that light and focuses upon Chris. She doesn't want to hurt her - but she closes her power all around her. There's just enough vibration leaking through for Chris to know what's happening. Chris freezes immediately. "Think about what you're doing," she says in a tight voice. "I thought about it," Yesenia says. "And I want you to go away. And leave me alone. Now." She waits a few breaths longer, to make sure Chris gets the point, and then releases the power. Chris glares at her, but then she goes to the car. A door handle extrudes as Chris reaches for it, and she gets inside the car. Yesenia watches the sleek black car back up, and she watches it leave the parking lot, and she keeps watching until it vanishes down the road. > IN The front door has been propped open with a rock, but there's no one in sight. Yesenia kicks it out of the way - why doesn't anyone understand security around here? - and swings her suitcase into the familiar darkness of her apartment building. Two flights of stairs later, she reaches the door to her apartment. Please press SPACE to continue. Tradewinds Apartments - Hallway During the day, the hallway's cool shadows provide relief from the California sun. But at night, it's simply dark, because the scattered wall sconces aren't close enough or bright enough to provide decent illumination. It couldn't be a better environment for the Jack of Shadows if someone had planned it that way. Yesenia never realized that before, and she feels sick at the idea. The door of Yesenia's apartment stands wide open. There's a folded note taped to it. > GET NOTE Yesenia peels the note off the door. > READ NOTE It's a plain white piece of paper, folded into thirds. Illegible black marker has smudged through from the inside. > IN There's a muffled sound from within the apartment, and Yesenia calls Camilla's name as she crosses the threshold at speed. *** It could have been so much worse.
