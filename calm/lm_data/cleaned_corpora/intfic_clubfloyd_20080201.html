Post Office Tower, Observation Deck You are standing on the roof of the fifteen-storey Post Office Tower, with a breathtaking view of the entire town of Fairhaven.  A guardrail on the edge is all that stands between you and the Post Office Park far below.  High-altitude winds buffet you as you peer over.

In the distance you can see the ruins of your house, a garage, some stores, the library and school, and of course the very new and modern Post Office Tower to the north.

The old man pauses for a moment and scratches his head.  "Actually, you're our only contestant at the moment.  And I'm not so sure that you're lucky, either.
