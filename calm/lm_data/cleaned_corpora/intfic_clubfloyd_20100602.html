It seems that all roads lead to your food bowl: there's an alcove to the west, a small flap northward, a lumpy mountain to the east, and a pile of blankets southward. Your fallen Provider lies oddly still. As the figure steps through the door, he turns toward your fallen Provider, and hurries to his side. A short while later, a loud and horrible mewing approaches, and the white-furred ones come to take your Provider away. You're sorry to see him go. He was all hisses and growls, but he was a Provider nonetheless. You eventually devour the mountain of hard food, and take to Rival's old wood. As the weeks pass, you hunt with greater relish; in the shadows, or from an overhanging limb, you watch and you wait with heightened senses. One day, having nearly forgotten him, you spy your Provider rolling into the cottage on a shiny stool. He no longer grunts or glares at you; instead, he sits all day on his shiny stool, gazing sadly into the confusing box. As winter warms over, the Provider begins to invite you onto his lap for a ride to the aspens, or through the ferns emerging on the forest floor. You hunt the golden-feathered bird and chase new rivals from across the stream. He strokes your fur, even croons to you. During such moments, you do something you haven't done in a long time. You purr. *** You have won *** In that game you scored 100 out of a possible 100, in 501 turns, earning you the rank of contentment.
