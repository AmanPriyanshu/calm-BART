Rose and I looked silently all around and then at each other, trying to grasp any suspicious sound. Nothing.

A big one, indeed, as it covered most of the corridor I was suppossed to be in, its inner dim bluish light surrounding me. At the other side of the corridor, I could see Doc and Rose. They both were staring right at the spot where I was, as if they couldn't see me but were somehow aware that I could be there, watching them. They nodded at each other, Rose snapped her fingers, and they simultaneously drew away some curtains back them, revealing a huge elegantly framed painting with a family portrait... I could see a wealthy couple, a few kids... but the whole scenario vanished before I could dig into any detail, leaving me back at a dark ominous corridor again. Were they trying to show me something? Had they figured out how that strange vision phenomenon was working? Was that a portrait of the McDaniel family? I couldn't tell.

[STATE] A wooden ladder leading upstairs. [ACTION] up [STATE]  I carefully began to step onto the ladder when Doc's vision entered the library. He dropped a rope right under the hole. It magically raised itself to the ceiling while he cheerfully exclaimed "TA-DAA, beat that, silly Mikie!" and quickly began to make a skilful rope climbing exhibition. I knew he wasn't actually there, but couldn't help answering "Now, Mr. know-it-all, what's so wrong with using a ladder to go upstairs?" He was talking to himself, but  the timing was so surprisingly precise that I could swear he was addressing me while both of us were reaching upside "Yeah, yeah... I wonder who the hell was the moron who screwed the ladder..." ... ...Oops! I realized then that the wooden ladder was so rotten that it was on the verge of collapsing under my weight. I desperately jumped towards the ceiling hole, miraculously reaching upstairs in the last moment before the ladder turned into a pile of shreds on the lower floor... That was close...! Dimly lit room I was in a dimly lit room upstairs. Some light entered from the corridor to the west, but it still wasn't enough to move without the torch.

I saw... that was it... an army of ghosts. They were just an indescribable legion of formless shadows I could just refer to as ghosts. At the other end of the corridor Doc stood defiantly carrying a shining sword "Now, minions of hell, you're going to taste my ghost slayer blade" and with a barbarian-like howl he charged against them all... smashing them apart while he kept running. "Wait..." I thought. Perhaps he got too carried away, as he didn't stop in the corridor and entered the room in an unstoppable rush which lead him directly to the trapdoor hole... "Yiaaaahhh...!!" CRASH!! "Ouch... That must have hurt!!" I thought, and looked into the hole to see Doc's shiny vision lying on the floor below... in time to see Rose's fuzzy image running towards him... "It's okay, it's okay" he said "It's been just some scrapes... You're not to worr..." But she wouldn't let him finish. Giving away a side of herself I would never have wanted to see, she embraced him tenderly until they both merged in a long, passionate kiss. And I knew then, being the unnoticed witness of their privacy, that as certain as there was a real world outside of the house, any wish, any hope I had concerning Rose would never, ever, fit in it. Their images vanished again as I realized they were stuck downstairs, and if there were an exit to the house it was on my side, so it was up to me to find it and eventually come back to their rescue.

With my first step, I was entering into an attic room, with the next, it was just like the room itself was entering into my head. It was hard to discern whether I was in two different locations at the same time or having two totally different perceptions of a same place. One was a dark room where I could hardly distinguish a window that, for no reason, I thought led the way to the landscape of another world. I was afraid to look into it, thinking that just gazing there would get me lost forever. Other than that it didn't matter where I turned the torchlight to, it was all a deep hole of inscrutable blackness. The other one was a sea of shining blue where I just couldn't measure any distance or have any reliable notion of location. Simultaneously in both of them, or somewhere in between, or just floating around me, a pale blue presence. When it somehow spoke to me, the amount of shocking sensory nonsense went far beyond my coping capacity: I think I lost my consciousness for a while... When I came back I was greeted by a female voice... "Hello there... you're an unwelcome guest, and my name is Indy". I was so shaken and exhausted after all the previous sequence of surrealist nightmares that I just wasn't aware, or couldn't care less, if I was taking it too casually given the circumstances. "Indy for Indiana? Indy for independent? Indy as in..." "...Indigo" And I was still surrounded by the dark, but it was just like her voice made the whole room change its colour.
