[STATE] A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every citizen's head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery half-existence of an underground operative, you've sabotaged, stolen, publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last mission means that a strategy to counter the government's ubiquitous tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head. For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner of the City. Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it's enough to make you scream. Valley of Steel A tale of the surveillance society by The Custodian of [LINK]  Green Residential Park Primrose Street ends here in a small circular cul-de-sac.  You're in a small green park to the north of this, bounded on its three other sides by high fences.  A few trees rise over well-manicured grass. There is a curfew sign at the park's entrance. The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline. You can go south from here. There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.
