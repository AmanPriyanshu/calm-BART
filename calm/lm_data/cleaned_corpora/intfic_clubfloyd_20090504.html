[ACTION] examine slippers [STATE] They have rabbit ears and are a collector's item from before the plague years. They are also pink. Your friend Jane gave them to you, motivated by inscrutable Jane-like humor; they still bear the stamp of Salvage and Reclamation on the soles.  Presumably your felonious dockworker recognized their worth and decided it was better not to steal them, but under the circumstances you'd rather have some of the clothing you actually intended to wear. It occurs to you that you left your old black sweater aboard the shuttle. Irritating. Your mother's silver kiddush cup. Most likely the only reason you got to keep it is the Star of David on the base, alerting the dockworker to its significance. Much of your time, the last days before departure, was spent getting rid of things. Jane helped, though no longer officially employed by Salvage and Reclamation. ("If you don't want to take the slippers with you, I won't be offended," she said, standing over a cardboard box, hands on hips. "It was just a present for fun." But you insisted on keeping them.) Getting rid of Katie: you hadn't been dating long, and neither of you pretended to consider maintaining a relationship at long distance. "It's been nice getting to know you, David," she said, before she hung up. Getting rid of obligations: you will not be home when your mother's yahrzeit comes around, and there is no one else. You have no brothers and no sisters. You had to look up the right words online; went to her grave with a flimsy print-off, and sang the Kaddish in a thin rain, though no one was listening to your prayers but a groundskeeper in a flap-eared hat. He watched with his arms folded from the next plot. When you were two-thirds through, he snorted and went away. So you still have the cup, at least. But you rarely use it, and what would it mean to do so here? Your music would have been more use. Bedroom There's no real bed, only a stone platform, too short to accommodate your full height, in the center of the room.

A refreshment room is visible to the west, and the hallway is back to the south. Your suitcase lies open on the floor, displaying a yellow paper note, some fuzzy bunny slippers, and a silver kiddush cup. It is deep red stone, decorated with bands of small colorful tiles. There's no attempt to accommodate a body either human or otherwise. And no sheets or blankets, which is discouraging. Refreshment Room Divided into several sections for hygienic purposes. To one side are the toilet facilities; on the other side, the food cabinet. Eating is considered a disgusting bodily function, here: something to be done out of sight and only when necessary. A long scarlet robe in the native style hangs from a clothing stand. Slightly raised from the floor by the door is a round grate, evidently the output vent for something-or-other. The purpose of clothes here is to keep a person warm while disguising as much as possible the presence of a solid body. They're made of light but tightly-woven material, generously cut, and studded with floatpins, allowing the cloth to hover, drift, and swirl perpetually without coming into indecent contact with the flesh. The robe is designed to drape from the shoulders, with several shorter layers of floatpinned cape at the back. It must billow magnificently when a person walks, and double as a sail in a strong wind.

[ACTION] time [STATE] It is 1:31 pm -- here, anyhow. Front Stairs The Embassy proper is directly west. The entrance is flanked by orange trees, familiar and earthly. From the top of the Front Stairs you have an excellent view of the whole interior of the Solarium, the sunlight catching in the curved triangular panes of glass. East, at the bottom of the stairs, is the mirror-glass of the pool. Beyond it the botanical garden has a structure invisible from the inside. Reflecting Pool You stand at the western end of a shallow rectangular pool -- no doubt part of the reason the air is softer and more humid here than it was outside. The garden paths open at the east end of the pool; the Embassy is west, at your back. If you look down, you catch the reflection in the surface, and a number of small red fish swimming around, in formation, making symbols which you cannot read. You wander between plots: what catches your eye this time is a writing-desk-tree, spreading to a flat surface at about three feet. Grand Solarium The Grand Solarium is an enormous dome with an oval roof of glass and grown metalwork. Inside is a botanical garden, which, on this planet, is a kind of art museum. Each plot displays some invented shrub that would be illegal on Earth. The southern end of the dome, where they grow edible crops, is hidden by a decorative screen of hanging flowers. The garden also continues to the east; away to the west is the front of the Earth Embassy, now your home. A double set of insulating doors leads north to the outdoors. You head out of the Solarium and down a brief slope, into the clearing at the center of town. Clearing The street runs north/south, so that you have an uninterrupted view of Cordia Peak, and the leading edge of the glacier at the northern edge of town. Both sides of the street are built up. A substantial building of metal and glass lies to the east, houses to the west. The ring system is mostly obscured by the grand solarium to the south, accessible through the insulating doors. The solarium is a huge domed structure to keep in as much heat and warmth as possible; the Earth embassy is inside. At the center of the open space here is a monument shaped like a tusk or tooth. It has look of force-grown bone, monolithic and taller than a man. The symbolic lettering of the current language has been painted on the side, but the original carving is in Chinese and English: "To those who, in the name of the Company and for the advancement of knowledge, were killed, modified incorrectly, or born unfit." A repulsion field prevents you from entering the building without the proper security device. From here, you can go south (to grand solarium), east, or north (to the broad street).

Liam and Valenti are standing together, a little apart from the rest of the group. YOU VOTED AGAINST AYLENE! says Valenti. This was not intended as a personal insult! replies Liam, Indeed I am very sorry you should be distressed by her removal when you have come to stand on terms of friendship with her. But I fear that those qualities which you value in her, not least her desire to give pain to no one, are causing a delay which may prove disastrous to all. Valenti grunts. YOU ARE VERY STUPID. Cartoon Liam looks pale. Perhaps you are aware that the ambassador is not to be removed until after Gift Day; thus there remains some opportunity for her to conclude this business expeditiously, and retire with honor. If this is your desire, then it certainly lies in your power to assist her! Valenti walks out of the room. Liam turns to one side. A thought caption appears above his head: How distressing it is to be in the employ of one with so little understanding of the proprieties! And how much worse to have disappointed one whose capacities are so far inferior to one's own! [ACTION] set pointer to blue [STATE] The pointer turns with a heavy click.

Then Valenti grabs him by the middle of his robes where there are no floatpoints, and shoves violently. Liam falls hard on the sharp floor, mortified and astonished. Progress, Valenti repeats, dusting his hands. She stays until Gift Day,  Liam says, not trying to get up. Valenti nods curtly and goes out; the other people in the group tactfully turn aside. Liam wipes the back of his mouth with his hand. After a moment he crawls to the corner and is sick. The image flickers out, leaking warm juice from the recorder. [ACTION] squeeze red seed

She answers in her language, and the subtitle says: If it were me only. He stuffs his hands into his pockets, streamer and all. "It could be you only. With or without the treaty of cohabitation, I would still marry you." Your genes are bad. Why would I marry you? "For pleasure." The recording plays on: Valenti has stopped pacing and is watching her. She meets his eye and smiles a small smile. I do not know if I can walk all the rest of my life on dirt, even for you. "It's mostly floors, really," Valenti says, fists held rigidly in pockets. "The once-popular custom of walking barefoot in the dirt is a few hundred years behind us." Our greatest art is a disgusting offense on Earth. Do we go where we are despised? "I know," he says. "There are concessions I cannot make. If I tried, they would not be honored." He gives the tormented streamer another pull, and it breaks apart in his hands with a flash of grey light; here the recording ends. [ACTION] put red seed in funnel
