Rotating the tool you set the fuse to 42 tenths of a second. Jenkins takes the shell from you then loads it for Sergeant Thompson to fire. As the fuse expires the shell detonates into a cloud of white smoke that envelopes the aircraft. After what seems like minutes, the dive bomber emerges from the cloud in an ever tightening spiral. You watch with mixed emotions as the fuselage plunges into the warm waters of the Timor Sea. The rest of the gun crew erupts into a loud cheer as you scan the skies for any sign of parachutes. From the loud hailer in the command post comes the call of "Tally-ho" -- American P40 Kittyhawk fighters have engaged the bombers and all gun crews are to cease fire.

As you have just seen for yourself, we didn't get that warning. "We haven't been able to raise Melville on the radio since, so I need you to head out there and find out what is going on. They may have been bombed themselves or they may just be having radio trouble. Either way I need you to find out and report back to me so I've sent someone to ask Miki to take you out to the island. Go grab your gear then head down to the beach south of the oval. Miki will meet you there." [ACTION] south

"In order to prevent enemy boats from landing in Snake Bay where the observation post is, the Navy laid a series of concrete mooring blocks, each twenty feet across." Lieutenant Roberts reaches into the top pocket of his shirt and hands you a folded piece of paper. "This map shows the precise location of these blocks. They're too deep to affect Miki's canoe, but there is a motor launch based on Melville and if you need to bring that back you'll need to know where they are. The tidal flow is restricted in Snake Bay and with a six foot draft the launch draws too much to clear them, even on a high tide." "Thank you, sir," you reply at attention. "Oh, and Davis, be careful. I've got a bad feeling about this one but with the rest of the army having pulled further inland I just can't spare any more men to go with you." "I will, sir."
