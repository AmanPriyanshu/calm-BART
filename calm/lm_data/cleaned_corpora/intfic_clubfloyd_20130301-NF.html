I don't know, though--- these colors don't really go together. Colorism usually involves more realistic pairings, and I don't think humans are supposed to be that shade of orange. I think the blobby thing is meant to be a unicorn, but that's speculation. The tapestry was made by the late queen. I've heard stories about her prolific and unusual talent. I'm sure the old guy couldn't bear to throw it out, and nobody else could bear to look at it. There's a wobbly inscription woven into the corner. [ACTION] up
