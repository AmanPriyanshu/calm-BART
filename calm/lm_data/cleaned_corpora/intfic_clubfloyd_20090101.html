Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge of the surf at about half way up the beach.

[STATE] You drop the driftwood on the ground. You turn your face aside in a futile attempt to avoid the rain. [ACTION] north [STATE] You eye the still dry tunnel nervously. Carved by wind and waves, the sea tunnel burrows through the headland about half the way up the beach. It is unreachable when the tide is high, both to those wanting in... and out. And in your childhood dreams you often found yourself trapped inside as the waves grew ever higher, your screams for help being carried out to sea. Moments later the water would come rushing through the tunnel and do the same to you. You  glance up at the clouds. Though it's pouring rain now, it seems the clouds are thinning to the west. Perhaps this will all blow over soon, but until it does there is nowhere else dry to go. So summoning your courage, you dash between the waves, scramble up the rocks, and enter the tunnel. Tunnel's Entrance The narrow opening of the sea tunnel looks southward across the beach and to the granite cliffs beyond. From here, by craning your head around the rocks to the east, you are just able to make out the tips of the cypress trees, looking like ghostly shadows as the clouds pass by. Waves rolling in from the west tumble over the rocks below, sending up a heavy shower of spray and then move on. After a few moments it becomes clear that this spot offers little in the way of protection from the driving rain, and the cold sea spray is actually making things worse. As fears of the past are swept away by the realities of the present, you make your way further into the tunnel, squeezing past its narrowest point, then hurrying on to the northern end. Tunnel's End The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to the pounding sea. Wide gaps in the stones above allow in just enough light to clearly see the masses of barnacles clustered around fissures in the stones and the slippery green algae on the tunnel floor that makes the footing treacherous. Near the opening, half covered in algae, is a flattened stone standing somewhat apart from the rest. [ACTION] examine stone

Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge of the surf at about half way up the beach.

It is unreachable when the tide is high, both to those wanting in... and out. And in your childhood dreams you often found yourself trapped inside as the waves grew ever higher, your screams for help being carried out to sea. Moments later the water would come rushing through the tunnel and do the same to you. You  glance up at the clouds. Though it's pouring rain now, it seems the clouds are thinning to the west. Perhaps this will all blow over soon, but until it does there is nowhere else dry to go. So summoning your courage, you dash between the waves, scramble up the rocks, and enter the tunnel. Tunnel's Entrance The narrow opening of the sea tunnel looks southward across the beach and to the granite cliffs beyond. From here, by craning your head around the rocks to the east, you are just able to make out the tips of the cypress trees, looking like ghostly shadows as the clouds pass by. Waves rolling in from the west tumble over the rocks below, sending up a heavy shower of spray and then move on. After a few moments it becomes clear that this spot offers little in the way of protection from the driving rain, and the cold sea spray is actually making things worse. As fears of the past are swept away by the realities of the present, you make your way further into the tunnel, squeezing past its narrowest point, then hurrying on to the northern end. Tunnel's End The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to the pounding sea. Wide gaps in the stones above allow in just enough light to clearly see the masses of barnacles clustered around fissures in the stones and the slippery green algae on the tunnel floor that makes the footing treacherous.

This game was written as a Landscape/Scenery entry for the Interactive Fiction Art Show. Almost all nouns in the text should be fair game for examining, with the other senses (listen, touch, taste, smell) supplied when I thought it was appropriate. Although the number of takeable objects has been kept to a minimum as per the rules of the show, there are a few so feel free to try it. Note: Players might find it useful to REMEMBER from time to time, especially at changes in scenery or situation. Though I set out to make it plotless, I quickly realized I couldn't write that way. We all approach a scene with our own set of memories, likes, dislikes, etc., and the PC (player character - you) is no different. As soon as I created a particular PC to be viewing these things, a plot crept in, and with a plot came a puzzle or two. They aren't meant to be confusing, and I hope you don't find them to be so. I want to acknowledge all those who have given help to me in the past; Andrew Plotkin, Gareth Rees, Marnie Parker, Magnus Olsen, Adam Cadre (for flags.h), Graham Nelson (for Inform, the language this is written in)... I wish I had kept better records so I could list you all. And to my husband, who gracefully accepted being a computer widower most of the time, and wisely dragged me away from the keyboard the rest of the time. A very special thank you to Irene Callaci, who, for the past year and half has been the reason I have kept writing every day, both recently on this little game, and on my REAL game (still in progress). Her daily question of: "So, what did you do last night?" and her limitless patience analyzing the answer, has kept me going though dreadful bugs and writers block, bad plots and worse writing. She has been as free with her wonderful ideas as with her code, and she is entirely to blame for the fact that I finally finished a game. Along with Irene, Jim Aikin and David Glasser and David Myers agreed to subject themselves to a beta version of this game, and all dutifully (gleefully?) reported my grammatical blunders, persistant failure to correctly use Mr. Apostrophe, repetitious code, plot holes, RAM errors (Read-Authors-Mind) and the like. Many thanks! Finally, I should note that as this is my first (released) game, I would dearly love to hear any thoughts/questions/opinions/suggestions you might have.

A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up high into the air. You gently kiss the faded blossom then toss it out onto the sea. "Rest in peace, Jason," you whisper as you watch it bob upon the water. Moments later it's caught up in the churning waves and pulled beneath the surface. "Amelia!" comes a cry from far above, barely audible over a sudden rush of water to the south. How long have you been in here? Looking up toward the cliffs you are surprised to see a familiar coach and four standing precariously close to the edge. "Ethan, get the horses back," you yell, cupping your hands around your mouth in a futile attempt to be heard. How did he know where to find you? "Amelia!" comes the cry again, this time more frantic. Tunnel's End The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to the pounding sea. Wide gaps in the stones above allow in just enough light to clearly see the masses of barnacles clustered around fissures in the stones and the slippery green algae on the tunnel floor that makes the footing treacherous.

Tunnel's Entrance The narrow opening of the sea tunnel looks out upon the beach, or what is left of it, for the tide has come in so far that some of the larger waves are spilling over the small rocks at the base of the cliffs. You find yourself trembling as you look out at the wild sea. Six years ago you stood on this very spot and looked out at this same sea... but this time, you're alone. A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up high into the air. You watch as the rest of the wave continues its course toward the shore. You freeze, just as you had six years ago. "Jump Amy, jump!" Jason had screamed in your ear as the waves slammed into the rocks, pouring water into the tunnel. How many times had you heard that scream in your dreams? How many times had you wished you had listened? You find yourself trembling as you look out at the wild sea. Six years ago you stood on this very spot and looked out at this same sea... but this time, you're alone. Holding your breath, you turn sideways and squeeze past the tunnel's narrowest point, then hurry on to its northern end with the sea lapping at your heels. "Ethan, I'm here!" you scream as a wave enters the southern end of the tunnel, sweeping over your feet and pour out the northern end. Tunnel's End The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to the pounding sea. Wide gaps in the stones above allow in just enough light to clearly see the masses of barnacles clustered around fissures in the stones and the slippery green algae on the tunnel floor that makes the footing treacherous. Near the opening is a flattened stone standing somewhat apart from the rest. It's happening all over again, just like before, only this time Jason isn't here to help. What was he trying to tell you that day? You never could figure it out. The wind had been so strong, ripping the words out of his mouth and blowing them away. He finally grabbed your hand and gave it a squeeze, pointing up toward the narrow gap in the ceiling. You look up at the ceiling now, the gap seeming as unreachable as ever. A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up high into the air. You watch as the rest of the wave continues its course toward the coast, past jagged offshore rocks jutting up from the sea, only to die upon the barren shore. The gaps are out of reach. A thick, swirling mass of water rushes in from the southern end of the tunnel and pours out the tunnel into the sea, nearly taking you with it. The gaps vary from a few inches to a few feet in diameter. The ceiling is soaked. A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up high into the air. You have so far scored 25 out of a possible 28, in 114 turns. You blush when you realize that you aren't actually in anything. A thick, swirling mass of water rushes in from the southern end of the tunnel and pours out the tunnel into the sea, nearly taking you with it. Just as you did six years before, you curl your finger around the pitted stone and attempt to haul yourself up the rocks. But this time Jason isn't there to push you the rest of the way up, and you slide back down. While you are preparing to try again, your hand is hit by a sturdy strap of leather tossed down from above. "Amelia, grab the rein," calls Ethan, his voice barely audible over the sound of the waves. Wrapping the rein around your hand, you once again scramble up the rocks. A moment later you find yourself standing on the rim of the tunnel, caught up in Ethans arms as he wraps his thick black cloak around you. Another wave sweeps through the tunnel at your feet, sending a shower of spray up high above your head. But the sea has no power over you now. This time there is no one left behind for it to claim. *** The End *** In that game you scored 26 out of a possible 28, in 115 turns.
