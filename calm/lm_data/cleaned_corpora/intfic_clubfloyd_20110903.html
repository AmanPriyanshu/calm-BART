Outside, the room is empty bar for smoking machinery and Dr. Kurner's body, slumped out on the floor. Somewhere, an alarm is blaring. [ACTION] listen
[STATE] We fin over the dome of mortuary, where the metal turns black with a heaving darkness. Our motion sets a rustle in the water like the waving of seaweed and some of the shoal tries to leave in a panic.  The darkness below is moving.  It's coming nearer.  It's rushing from the seabed in a motion like the unfolding of the earth.  It is a giant, wrapping hand, that our kaleidoscope eyes see from all sides and form into a huge rounded trunk in our mind.  The whole object encompasses us until a mouth is doing the same.  The rest try to swim away, finning back madly over the corridor toward the dome.  The shadow follows, boiling out of the sand, revealing its shadow full.  Sweeps over the corridor, more of us are lost.  We try to out-shake it.  We fail.  Flitter, flurry, fade, in blackness. Eyes open.  You feel somewhat dizzy.  You can't remember how to tie a tie, you note, which at least means one got away. Inside the Cylinder The glass door has slid open.

[STATE] The switch does nothing - the door does not slide shut. [ACTION] out [STATE] You step out of the cylinder.  From here you can see the screen in the corner of the room, which shows a giant multi-tentacled creature growing from over the mortuary dome, coming closer. Machine Room Your machine is in one corner, forgotten.  Dr. Kurner slumps on the floor, quite dead, almost forgotten too. The alarm is blaring.  A voice over the intercom shrieks "What are we going to do?  General?  WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?" [ACTION] search body

[STATE] The brand is a small black button - a tattoo just left of his lifeline. Beneath it is inscribed "Press for detonation." [ACTION] push brand [STATE] You jab the button on Dr. Kurner's palm and for two seconds everything shakes.  A stream of bubbles, like a jet passing, rips outside the window.  The water there turns deep red, then slowly back to blue, and the room falls still. Moments later Zak dives in.  "Professor!  You're awake!  You'd never believe what happened!" "Attacked by a giant squid?" "Yeah!  Um."  He frowns a bit.  "I guess you saw it on the screen. Hey!  Is Dr. Kurner alright?  What happened to him?" "He laid down his life," is your reply.  "To save the lab." Zak hears this, and his frown deepens.  "I guess you'd know," he replies uncertainly. *** All's well that ends well *** *** Except for Kurner, that is *** You may restore a saved game, start over, quit, or undo the current command.
