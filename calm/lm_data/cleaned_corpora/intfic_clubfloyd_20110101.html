Clyde Beauregard Dalton in 1933.  Clyde Dalton was born in 1898, the second of two children from Beauregard and Esther Lynn Dalton, wealthy cattle ranchers from Lubbock, Texas. Clyde and his brother, Claude, came to what was then known as Port Dietrich in 1922.  From an inheritance left by their parents, Claude opened a meat-packing plant while Clyde began investing money to local businesses.  The meat-packing plant and the businesses funded by Clyde helped the growth of Port Dietrich.  In 1925, the increasing port population and growth of the economy, despite nationwide depression, made Port Dietrich eligible for "town" status.  With considerable influence from the Dalton brothers, Port Dietrich was renamed "Dalton."  Claude left the Dalton estate in 1930. Clyde Dalton, an influential Board member and businessman himself, remained.  Clyde Dalton passed in 1949 and is buried in Dalton Cemetery.'
