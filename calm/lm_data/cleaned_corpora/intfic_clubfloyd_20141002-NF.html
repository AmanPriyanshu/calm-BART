[STATE]  Peristyle Just inside the manor property, you find yourself sheltered by the roof over the southern colonnade of a peristyle that surrounds an overgrown courtyard on three sides.  The outer wall is closed in by bricks, and iron gatework prevents entry to the courtyard between the inner columns holding up the edge of the roof. The colonnade leads east and west over crooked slate tiles. Two square brick columns border the entryway, each topped with a wrought-iron gaslight cage, taking up area about the size of a phone booth on each side and spaced far enough apart that a double-hitched carriage could be driven through into the courtyard.
