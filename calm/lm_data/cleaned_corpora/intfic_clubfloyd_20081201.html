"I'm not sure I'd ever given it much thought," you replied, "I suppose I'd be pretty content to be remembered as a decent sort of bloke."

Old Library Dance Floor Although this place is called the Old Library, no one's read a book here in living memory.

You mainly recall music too loud for conversation and a floor too crowded to dance on without bumping into people at every turn; it really wasn't your scene at all. You only bought a ticket because you knew she'd be here. And so she was, effortlessly elegant in plain black, standing out from all the others in their colourful finery like a princess among apes. You kept stealing hopeful glances at her all evening. Surprisingly, for much of the time she seemed to be dancing with some nerdish-looking teenager (at the time you supposed either that she must have felt sorry for him and was just being nice, or else that he must be some cousin she'd been lumbered with for the evening). At last, when you'd given up all hope and had gone in search of a refill for your glass, she came up to you and asked you for a dance. You'd been secretly hoping for a slow romantic sway, of course, but your luck being what it was all you got was an energetic jive. At least, she was commendably energetic about it (but graceful with it, of course), which left you feeling a bit like a lumbering elephant with four left feet in comparison.

The ring road continues to both east and west. You vividly recall one occasion when you were driving this way. It was shortly after graduation and you were driving a group of friends back from a celebratory party. The traffic suddenly slowed to a crawl and you became aware of flashing blue lights a short way up ahead. "Quick; change places with me," she said. "But..." you began to protest. "Don't argue, there isn't much time." she insisted. There was something about her tone of voice that silenced any further argument, so you surreptitiously changed places before the traffic started moving again.

[STATE] Elm Bridge You must have driven down this section of road a dozen times without being more than minimally aware that it crosses the river at this point, but on foot it's all too obvious; you can stop and stare at the moonlight reflecting off the water without a single car headlight to disturb you. The ring road continues to both east and west. You vividly recall one occasion when you were driving this way. It was shortly after graduation and you were driving a group of friends back from a celebratory party. The traffic suddenly slowed to a crawl and you became aware of flashing blue lights a short way up ahead. "Quick; change places with me," she said. "But..." you began to protest. "Don't argue, there isn't much time." she insisted. There was something about her tone of voice that silenced any further argument, so you surreptitiously changed places before the traffic started moving again.

Suddenly, the silence is rent by the roar of engines. You leap out of the way just in time as a sports car races past, hotly pursued by a police car with lights flashing and sirens blazing. Both cars vanish off to the west, and the road falls silent once more. [ACTION] examine hoarding

[ACTION] additional [STATE]  Review your memories Other things to try Over the course of the game you should have visited a number of places that have triggered memories. Viewing these in sequence should help you form some idea of the back-story. Playground: This was a co-ed school, and this playground was where you first saw her, all those years ago. Perhaps your recollection of that first encounter has been coloured by events of the last two decades, but as you recall it, when your eyes met across the playground it was as if everything else around receded into two-dimensional monochrome, and she was the only three-dimensional technicolour object left in your field of view. Again, as you recall, she smiled shyly at you, and you went and introduced yourself in your earnest six-year-old fashion, but so much fantasy and wishful thinking has surrounded the frequent rehearsal of that memory that you can't really remember what either of you actually said. Church Street Bus Stop: There are many bus-stops in the city, but only this one holds special memories for you. As a teenager you often used to wait here for your bus home from school. It was on her route home, too, and though she took a different bus from yours, you'd sometimes spot her on her bus when it stopped here. Once or twice she spotted you too, and then she'd always smile and wave, as if you were some long-lost friend. And even as a teenager she was so pretty! Residence Hall Lobby: You ran into her here in your first week as a student. You hesitated to approach her because, in all conscience, you hardly knew her, but while you were debating with yourself whether it was worth trying to renew your acquaintance, she flashed you a lovely smile and walked up to you. "Hello," she said, tossing her long dark hair over back her shoulder, "don't I know you? We were at primary school together, weren't we?" "That's right," you agreed, "though it seems a long time ago now. I'm flattered you remember!" "It's nice to see a familiar face!" she told you, "so what are you reading here?" "Law," you told her,  "and you?" "English," she replied, adding with a laugh "much less practical! Talking of which, I'm in danger late of being late for my first Dickens lecture, and I'd hate to upset my prof on my first day, so I'd better dash before Great Expectations turn into Bleak House! We'll catch up later." And after a fashion, over the next three years you did, but nowhere near as much as you'd have liked. Club Terrace: When you were a student, perhaps in your second year, you attended a particularly dire party in the club. All that smoke and beer and loud music wasn't really your scene, and the more everyone else around you seemed to be having "fun", the more fed up you felt, until eventually you wandered out here for some kind of relief from it all. You hadn't been out here that long when she came to join you, announcing her arrival by laying a friendly hand on your shoulder. "Hello," she said, "I hope you're not avoiding me!" "Certainly not!" you replied, "You're the last person I'd want to avoid!" "I'm glad to hear it," she smiled. "Shall we go somewhere else then?" you suggested hopefully, "How about a quiet drink at the KA?" For one moment you thought she was about to say yes, but instead she dashed your hope with an apologetic shake of the head. "Some other time," she replied, "I'd better go in; I'm with people." Then, with a parting pat on your arm, she turned away and went off to join the party in the club. It was several more years before you had that drink with her in the Kings Arms. Cinema Auditorium: You came here once with her to see a film when you were both students, it was one of the few occasions you actually went out with her. If you remember rightly the film was Titanic, but at the time you were much more interested in her than the film. Typically, she seemed so much more interested in the film than you that she didn't even notice where your interest lay. Elm Bridge: You vividly recall one occasion when you were driving this way. It was shortly after graduation and you were driving a group of friends back from a celebratory party. The traffic suddenly slowed to a crawl and you became aware of flashing blue lights a short way up ahead. "Quick; change places with me," she said. "But..." you began to protest. "Don't argue, there isn't much time." she insisted. There was something about her tone of voice that silenced any further argument, so you surreptitiously changed places before the traffic started moving again. A few dozen yards further on the police stopped the car and asked her to blow into a breathalyzer (there weren't meant to be random breath tests in those days, but they found some pretext). She, of course, was clean. To this day you don't know whether you would have been, but you're profoundly grateful that it wasn't put to the test. Hotel Lobby: This place holds two poignant memories for you. The first is of Kate's 21st birthday party; she needed somewhere large for all her friends. She was really dazzling that night, with her whole life before her. Alas, she never lived to see her 22nd birthday. The recollection of that evening brings home to you just how much you miss her still. The second is more recent, from about three years ago. You took her out to dinner here, a week or so after that drink in the Kings Arms. She, too, seemed really dazzling that night, sparkling with wit and conversation, utterly charming throughout the entire meal. Even though in hindsight some of the things she said may have been just a little odd, at the time you were just happy to enjoy her company -- until, right at the end, she dropped her little bombshell. "Thanks for a lovely evening, David," she told you, "but now there's something I really ought to tell you. I've just started seeing Jeremy." "Seeing Jeremy," you repeated dully, feeling the whole evening crumbling around you. "I mean I'm going out with him," she explained patronisingly, as if you hadn't understood perfectly well what she meant. Lafayette's: You once brought Kate here for a meal a few weeks after her twenty-first birthday. You weren't sure you wanted a relationship with Kate, but you weren't sure you didn't want one either. She was frighteningly clever, but she was also kind, warm-hearted and extraordinarily perceptive. Above all, she was someone you could really talk to, more than anyone else you knew at the time. You can't remember much of what you talked about that evening, but you vividly recall one snippet of the conversation. "Do you wish it was her with you here tonight?" she asked quietly. It was obvious to both of you whom she meant, so you didn't bother to query it. Instead you replied, "She's an interesting enough woman, I suppose, but I'm very happy with the company I've got." "So am I," Kate smiled wistfully, "But I can see you fancy her all the same. You shouldn't go so much on externals." Mandlebury Bridge: You have, just once before, seen the bridge that deserted - a night burned on your memory. You were walking home from a late party - if only you had left that party a few minutes earlier you might have arrived here just in time to prevent Kate's death. Embankment: This is where you found her that dreadful night, seven years ago. Her clothes were soaked of course, but it's the water streaming from her long dark hair that you remember most vividly now - that and the fact that she was kneeling by Kate's body. She looked up, obviously distressed, but then relieved to see a familiar face. "She fell - off the bridge" she gasped, swallowing hard as she wiped the damp hair out of her eyes, "I don't know how - just a few minutes ago - I tried to save her - but - well - I dived in and I managed to get her out - but she's not breathing!" For a moment you just stood there, overcome by shock as you stared at her, unwilling to take in what she had just said. Then she galvanised you into action: "For goodness' sake! Don't just stand there! Fetch help! Go and call an ambulance!" And so off you ran, south towards the city hospital. Hospital Reception: You'll never forget waiting here, with her beside you, still wet from her misadventure and shaking from cold and shock. She made no objection when you put your arm round her, and even nestled her head on your shoulder, but there was nothing amorous about it, you were worried sick about Kate and just looking for comfort. It didn't last all that long anyway, for it was only a few minutes until the doctor came out to confirm that Kate was dead. So then you spent the next few hours talking to the police. Police Station Reception Area: The last time you were here was when the police called you in to go over your statement about Kate's drowning, just a couple of days before the Inquest at the Coroner's Court just round the corner. They seemed particularly interested in what you could tell them about Kate's state of mind, but you couldn't really add much to the statement you'd given them in the Hospital just after the event. Cornwallis Avenue Nth: You remember you had to attend the Coroner's Court after Kate drowned. It was a miserable business; the police doctor had confirmed that Kate's death was by drowning, but as you'd arrived on the scene so soon after she had fished Kate out of the river that you were an important witness. Although she (your friend, that is) said she'd seen Kate jump off the bridge, there was no suicide note and no evidence that Kate was feeling suicidal, so in the end the coroner's jury reached a verdict of death by misadventure. With the wisdom of hindsight you wish they'd been a bit more thorough and a lot more suspicious. Churchyard: Kate's grave is somewhere here among the others; you used to visit it often. You'll never forget the shock you received when you came one day only a few weeks after Kate's funeral to find the grave desecrated. At least, someone had knocked over the headstone and smashed it, and the flowers were all torn up and strewn around. The police never did catch the culprits, and put it down to local hooligans, but that never seemed quite satisfactory somehow; why should it be Kate's grave that was attacked in this way? It's long since been put right, of course, but the memory of the broken gravestone still leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Kate deserved better than that - much better. Nave: You remember when you came here for Kate's funeral, just over six years ago. She was sitting up in one of the front pews, quite unaware of your presence, although your eyes kept wandering to the back of her head. At some appropriate point in the service she went up to the lectern and made some thoroughly fitting speech about the tragically early death of her dear friend Kate, who had had a wonderful life ahead of her. You can't remember precisely what she said; what you remember is how solemn and composed she was as she spoke, saying just the right things in just the right sombre tone, without ever giving way to emotion and tears. High Street (Outside Hairdressers and Pub): You'll never forget the terrible shock you got when you happened to be passing this way not long after Kate's funeral (which had left you feeling pretty down in any case). She (not Kate - she) had stepped out of the Hairdressers, and for a moment you almost failed to recognize her, she'd had her hair cut so dreadfully short. You hated it at once; she'd had such a glorious mane of long dark hair, but this - well, it must have shown in your face, since she remarked, more than a little snippily. "I thought it was time for a change", and then stalked off up the street before you could reply. In the event she must have agreed with your judgement, though, since she never had her hair cut like that again; instead the way she let it grow longer year by year suggested she hardly had it cut again at all. photograph: It shows the climax of the graduation ceremony, with Kate shaking hands with the Vice-Chancellor as she receives the award for the best degree result of the year. A little way over to the left a group of graduands in academic robes stand looking on and applauding; among them are Jeremy, Nick, yourself - and her. It's her you look at, every bit as beautiful at twenty-one as she is today. She's applauding and smiling with the rest, but the smile looks a little forced. certificates: The certificates show a range of her achievements, but her degree certificate is conspicuous by its absence. University Hall: You attended three or four quite unmemorable lectures here when you were a student, but you mainly remember this hall for the two University rites of passage: matriculation and graduation. You can't even recall seeing her at the former, but she was definitely at the latter, and quite out of sorts that day -- you could scarcely get a cold nod out of her, let alone a word. Sports Ground: You don't come here much, sport really isn't your thing. But you did come a few times that summer, to watch the tennis tournament. She was in it. She reached the finals. You're no expert on tennis, but she seemed to be totally in control all the time; it was almost as if she were dancing round the court rather than exerting herself. She, won, of course: at least she won the women's singles, although she didn't do quite so well in the mixed doubles. When you spoke to her afterwards she seemed to be almost more preoccupied with that failure than with her success: "That idiot Nick!" she complained, "He was like an uncoordinated lobster on court! We should have won!" Concert Hall: You've attended many concerts here over the years, many of them good, but the one you remember best is the amateur performance of The Marriage of Figaro in which she sang the part of Cherubino. You thought she sang like an angel, and in your mind's ear you can still hear her beautiful rendition of the aria "Voi che sapete" - "You who know what love is". You came back to hear her again several nights in succession; it's fortunate that you're so fond of Mozart. Theatre Auditorium: Not all the events held here were as representative of high culture as the builders of this theatre might have hoped. Three or four years ago the city held a contest here to choose a beauty queen for some local pageant. Of course she was one of the contestants, and of course she won; most of the other contestants were pretty enough but next to her beauty they struck you as fireflies competing with the sun. It wasn't just a matter of her looks, though she certainly looked drop-dead gorgeous that night; at the time you imagined that she had far more poise, far more intelligence, and far more personality than the rest of them put together. Lounge Bar: You met her here about three years ago. You'd been giving her some routine legal advice on the phone, and you'd managed to drop the suggestion of a drink into the conversation. A little to your surprise she'd agreed, and that evening, you only had to wait for about five minutes before she walked in, spotted you from across the bar and came and joined you at your table. "Tell me," she said, once you'd bought her a drink and you'd both settled down for a chat, "What would you like to be remembered for?" "I'm not sure I'd ever given it much thought," you replied, "I suppose I'd be pretty content to be remembered as a decent sort of bloke." "Oh, I'm sure you'll be remembered for that, David!" she laughed, "But I've been thinking; how sad it must be to pass through life and never leave any kind of impression." "You seem to have made quite an impression round here already," you remarked. "Maybe -- but is it enough?" she wondered, "There are times when I feel that whatever I do, it's never quite enough!" "It sounds like you're demanding too much of yourself," you suggested. For a moment she stared at you, as if pondering how best to respond to this idea. Then she suddenly brightened, briskly changing the subject, "Sorry, I'm sure you don't want to hear about my existential angst all evening --  so, tell me about your day." So you did, and from there the conversation wandered on to other topics, till she quite suddenly announced that she had to leave. Mandlebury Park: When time permits you often come here to eat your lunch on the park bench. On one such occasion about four years ago you saw her jogging past on a circuit of the park. The second time round, she stopped to catch her breath and chat. You can't remember a great deal of the conversation , but you do remember she was enthusing about some book she'd just read. "Have you read any Stanilev?" she asked. "I've never heard of him," you admitted. "He's a great thinker, you should read him, you really should," she urged you, "Until I read him I never realized anyone else could feel that way. It was so liberating!" But though you promised her you'd look out for a copy of Stanilev's book, somehow you never got round to it until now. Public Library: You remember coming here about four or five years ago to borrow a novel, and seeing her sitting off to one side, concentrating on some book. You exchanged smiles, but that was about as far as you got before a frown from a fierce librarian silenced your incipient greeting. black book: The book has a plain black cover, on which is inscribed "Nightfall, by A.D. Stanilev". Art Gallery: Although art isn't really your thing, you came here about a year ago to see an exhibition of paintings entered into a competition for local amateurs. Or rather you came to see one painting in particular: her painting, the painting that won the competition. Her painting: Her painting, the winning entry, is still prominently on display. It portrays the city at sunset, with the buildings silhouetted in front of a blazing red glow. The painting is certainly striking, but you find it a little disturbing; it almost makes it look as if the whole city is on fire. The painting is called "Nightfall". You check the signature at the bottom right-hand corner, but it looks like her name, not the mysterious MASTEMA of the poster in her flat - curiouser and curiouser. Her Office: You've been here once or twice before; she's occasionally used your firm for legal advice. She set up in business here shortly after graduating, specializing in student lets. The business seems to have been moderately successful - at least, it's still going and she's not obviously poverty-stricken - but it's never grown, since she still works by herself after seven years at it. letter: It's a handwritten letter from Jeremy, dated about two years ago, breaking off his relationship with her. You re-read it, your eye stopping on phrases like, "I'm sorry, but it's over. I still find you as charming and attractive as I always did, and you can be great company, but I'm worn out by your need to always be the best at everything, and I've had enough of playing second fiddle to your ambition" and "We've had good times together, but I realize now that you're just not the woman for me" and "Even now I don't really feel I know you. I'm sure you do have a heart, but I've never felt you've ever really opened it to me; for such a successful woman you seem strangely repressed." The letter must obviously have been returned to him, since across the bottom is written in another hand: "You should have thought twice before rejecting me!" printed email: It's a printed copy of an email, addressed to her from one edward.dawlish@freegov.org. The main body of the email reads: > So I hope you will give very serious consideration to my > application to represent the party at the next general > election. We have given your CV and letter the most serious consideration but regret to inform you that we felt unable to add your name to our short-list of candidates. As I'm sure you will appreciate this has long been a safe seat, and we thus have an unusually strong field of potential candidates, many of whom already have considerable parliamentary experience. > I have been active in many aspects of local life, > and I believe this makes me uniquely well suited > to represent this community. Your participation and achievements in the life of this city have indeed been remarkable, and we recognize that. We accordingly feel you would make an *excellent* candidate for the city council, and very much hope you will consider offering yourself as a candidate for the forthcoming local elections (we could virtually guarantee to find you a winnable ward). Any experience gained as a local councillor would also stand you in very good stead should you wish to pursue parliamentary ambitions at some later date. The email is dated about two years ago. At the bottom of it is written in large red letters: "NO!". Junction of High Street and College Street: About two years ago you ran into her here as you were walking home, and she was doing the same, both of you rather later than normal. Your paths would normally have taken you in opposite directions, but instead of turning to walk down the High Street she took a detour up Hythe Bridge Street to walk along beside you. "Today has not been a good day," she explained, "I could do with seeing a friendly face!" So you walked on up Hythe Bridge Street together, but she seemed unwilling to say what was wrong. Junction of York Street and Hythe Bridge Street: About two years ago you had walked up from the other end of Hythe Bridge Street with her one evening, as she'd taken a slight detour from her normal route. You had stopped at this junction, since her way home lay south and yours lay north. It was just at this point on your walk that she came closest opening herself up to you. "Would you say I was a failure?" she asked. "Certainly not!" You declared, surprised by her question, "I've never known anyone succeed at so many things!" "But not everything," she sighed, "and maybe not at anything really important." On impulse you offered, "Shall I walk you home?" "Why not?" she replied. So you'd both headed south together, and you tried to get her to expand on what she had just said, but somehow the moment had been lost and she insisted on changing the subject. Gladstone Terrace: When you walked her home one night, about two years ago, this was as far as you got. You had hoped she would at least invite you in for a coffee. Indeed, for a moment you thought she seemed just on the point of doing so, but then all she said was, "Thank you - it was good to talk." Just before she turned away to let herself in, she added, "I'll see you around." Then she disappeared inside, leaving you standing in the street as if you could not possibly have expected anything else. Old Library Dance Floor: The last time you were here was a couple of years or so ago. You mainly recall music too loud for conversation and a floor too crowded to dance on without bumping into people at every turn; it really wasn't your scene at all. You only bought a ticket because you knew she'd be here. And so she was, effortlessly elegant in plain black, standing out from all the others in their colourful finery like a princess among apes. You kept stealing hopeful glances at her all evening. Surprisingly, for much of the time she seemed to be dancing with some nerdish-looking teenager (at the time you supposed either that she must have felt sorry for him and was just being nice, or else that he must be some cousin she'd been lumbered with for the evening). At last, when you'd given up all hope and had gone in search of a refill for your glass, she came up to you and asked you for a dance. You'd been secretly hoping for a slow romantic sway, of course, but your luck being what it was all you got was an energetic jive. At least, she was commendably energetic about it (but graceful with it, of course), which left you feeling a bit like a lumbering elephant with four left feet in comparison. But at the time you felt that one dance made the whole evening worthwhile. Morgans Bank: You ran into her here about eighteen months ago; she was just ahead of you in the queue. "Oh, hello!" she said, with one of her brighter smiles, "Are you here to take all your money out too? These people obviously can't be trusted with it!" "Why not?" you asked. "Didn't you hear about it on the news?" she replied, "Someone hacked into Morgans' mainframe and siphoned off a couple of million. Doesn't say much for their security, does it?" old newspaper: Most of it is missing, and the rest of it is at least several weeks old. Apart from the grease stains testifying to its use as a fish-and-chips wrapper, it is full of the usual bad news about undesirable things on the increase: inflation, unemployment, taxes, crime, global warming; according to one columnist, there's even a sharp rise in severe personality disorders among the under thirties. The sole surviving page of foreign news is no cheerier, since it bemoans increasing tension in the Middle East coupled with the danger of former Soviet republics selling nuclear weapons on the black market. large metal cylinder: The large metal cylinder is mostly silver in colour, and has various coloured wires attached to it. There's quite a bit of writing on it, but it's all in the Cyrillic alphabet. A quick glance at the civil defence manual does not prove reassuring -- the cylinder could well be a bomb. large poster: It's a monochrome photograph of a painting depicting sunset over the city. You recognize it as the winning entry in a recent art competition; the original hangs in the Art Gallery Market Street. The black and white photo is not nearly so striking as the oil-colour original, but perhaps the original would be too overpowering for a living room - at least you always find it a bit disturbing to look at. The photograph differs from the original in another odd way: the signature in the bottom right-hand corner should be her name, but instead it looks like MASTEMA. Supermarket: It was here that you last saw her, about ten days ago, when she came up behind you in the checkout queue. She seemed pleased to see you, and appeared to have made a deliberate choice to join your queue, but the conversation remained inconsequential until you were ready to leave. Just as you'd packed up your shopping and paid your bill, she became suddenly solemn. "If I ever needed you - I mean really needed you - you would be there for me, wouldn't you?" she asked. "Of course," you replied, without hesitation. "Good," she smiled, and then changed the subject to something inconsequential like the weather. familiar birthday card: You recognize it at once. It is the card you sent her for her birthday a few weeks ago, a safe, arty kind of card that showed you were thinking of her without suggesting anything soppy. You wonder why she kept it. Ticket Office: While you were queuing for your ticket, Jeremy turned to you and said, "She's still in the city, you know. She's not leaving; apparently there's something frantically important she has to do here." "More important than getting away from the Enemy?" you asked. "So she says," he replied, with a dismissive shrug, "Oh, and by the way, I nearly forgot. She asked me to give you this." He handed you a small brown envelope. You didn't need to ask who he meant. There were thousands of women in the city, but only one she - in Jeremy's case because of their relationship; in yours - well, it was then that your notion about staying behind for her finally started to harden into resolve. gold brooch: It's a gold brooch, in the form of a scorpion. The design is quite distinctive, and you're sure she has a brooch like that. You've often wondered what kind of statement it's meant to make: not that she's poisonous, to be sure, but you suspect she'd not be averse to suggesting she's not to be messed with.

[STATE]  Review your memories Other things to try Over the course of the game you should have visited a number of places that have triggered memories. Viewing these in sequence should help you form some idea of the back-story. Playground: This was a co-ed school, and this playground was where you first saw her, all those years ago. Perhaps your recollection of that first encounter has been coloured by events of the last two decades, but as you recall it, when your eyes met across the playground it was as if everything else around receded into two-dimensional monochrome, and she was the only three-dimensional technicolour object left in your field of view. Again, as you recall, she smiled shyly at you, and you went and introduced yourself in your earnest six-year-old fashion, but so much fantasy and wishful thinking has surrounded the frequent rehearsal of that memory that you can't really remember what either of you actually said. Church Street Bus Stop: There are many bus-stops in the city, but only this one holds special memories for you. As a teenager you often used to wait here for your bus home from school. It was on her route home, too, and though she took a different bus from yours, you'd sometimes spot her on her bus when it stopped here. Once or twice she spotted you too, and then she'd always smile and wave, as if you were some long-lost friend. And even as a teenager she was so pretty! Residence Hall Lobby: You ran into her here in your first week as a student. You hesitated to approach her because, in all conscience, you hardly knew her, but while you were debating with yourself whether it was worth trying to renew your acquaintance, she flashed you a lovely smile and walked up to you. "Hello," she said, tossing her long dark hair over back her shoulder, "don't I know you? We were at primary school together, weren't we?" "That's right," you agreed, "though it seems a long time ago now. I'm flattered you remember!" "It's nice to see a familiar face!" she told you, "so what are you reading here?" "Law," you told her,  "and you?" "English," she replied, adding with a laugh "much less practical! Talking of which, I'm in danger late of being late for my first Dickens lecture, and I'd hate to upset my prof on my first day, so I'd better dash before Great Expectations turn into Bleak House! We'll catch up later." And after a fashion, over the next three years you did, but nowhere near as much as you'd have liked. Club Terrace: When you were a student, perhaps in your second year, you attended a particularly dire party in the club. All that smoke and beer and loud music wasn't really your scene, and the more everyone else around you seemed to be having "fun", the more fed up you felt, until eventually you wandered out here for some kind of relief from it all. You hadn't been out here that long when she came to join you, announcing her arrival by laying a friendly hand on your shoulder. "Hello," she said, "I hope you're not avoiding me!" "Certainly not!" you replied, "You're the last person I'd want to avoid!" "I'm glad to hear it," she smiled. "Shall we go somewhere else then?" you suggested hopefully, "How about a quiet drink at the KA?" For one moment you thought she was about to say yes, but instead she dashed your hope with an apologetic shake of the head. "Some other time," she replied, "I'd better go in; I'm with people." Then, with a parting pat on your arm, she turned away and went off to join the party in the club. It was several more years before you had that drink with her in the Kings Arms. Cinema Auditorium: You came here once with her to see a film when you were both students, it was one of the few occasions you actually went out with her. If you remember rightly the film was Titanic, but at the time you were much more interested in her than the film. Typically, she seemed so much more interested in the film than you that she didn't even notice where your interest lay. Elm Bridge: You vividly recall one occasion when you were driving this way. It was shortly after graduation and you were driving a group of friends back from a celebratory party. The traffic suddenly slowed to a crawl and you became aware of flashing blue lights a short way up ahead. "Quick; change places with me," she said. "But..." you began to protest. "Don't argue, there isn't much time." she insisted. There was something about her tone of voice that silenced any further argument, so you surreptitiously changed places before the traffic started moving again. A few dozen yards further on the police stopped the car and asked her to blow into a breathalyzer (there weren't meant to be random breath tests in those days, but they found some pretext). She, of course, was clean. To this day you don't know whether you would have been, but you're profoundly grateful that it wasn't put to the test. Hotel Lobby: This place holds two poignant memories for you. The first is of Kate's 21st birthday party; she needed somewhere large for all her friends. She was really dazzling that night, with her whole life before her. Alas, she never lived to see her 22nd birthday. The recollection of that evening brings home to you just how much you miss her still. The second is more recent, from about three years ago. You took her out to dinner here, a week or so after that drink in the Kings Arms. She, too, seemed really dazzling that night, sparkling with wit and conversation, utterly charming throughout the entire meal. Even though in hindsight some of the things she said may have been just a little odd, at the time you were just happy to enjoy her company -- until, right at the end, she dropped her little bombshell. "Thanks for a lovely evening, David," she told you, "but now there's something I really ought to tell you. I've just started seeing Jeremy." "Seeing Jeremy," you repeated dully, feeling the whole evening crumbling around you. "I mean I'm going out with him," she explained patronisingly, as if you hadn't understood perfectly well what she meant. Lafayette's: You once brought Kate here for a meal a few weeks after her twenty-first birthday. You weren't sure you wanted a relationship with Kate, but you weren't sure you didn't want one either. She was frighteningly clever, but she was also kind, warm-hearted and extraordinarily perceptive. Above all, she was someone you could really talk to, more than anyone else you knew at the time. You can't remember much of what you talked about that evening, but you vividly recall one snippet of the conversation. "Do you wish it was her with you here tonight?" she asked quietly. It was obvious to both of you whom she meant, so you didn't bother to query it. Instead you replied, "She's an interesting enough woman, I suppose, but I'm very happy with the company I've got." "So am I," Kate smiled wistfully, "But I can see you fancy her all the same. You shouldn't go so much on externals." Mandlebury Bridge: You have, just once before, seen the bridge that deserted - a night burned on your memory. You were walking home from a late party - if only you had left that party a few minutes earlier you might have arrived here just in time to prevent Kate's death. Embankment: This is where you found her that dreadful night, seven years ago. Her clothes were soaked of course, but it's the water streaming from her long dark hair that you remember most vividly now - that and the fact that she was kneeling by Kate's body. She looked up, obviously distressed, but then relieved to see a familiar face. "She fell - off the bridge" she gasped, swallowing hard as she wiped the damp hair out of her eyes, "I don't know how - just a few minutes ago - I tried to save her - but - well - I dived in and I managed to get her out - but she's not breathing!" For a moment you just stood there, overcome by shock as you stared at her, unwilling to take in what she had just said. Then she galvanised you into action: "For goodness' sake! Don't just stand there! Fetch help! Go and call an ambulance!" And so off you ran, south towards the city hospital. Hospital Reception: You'll never forget waiting here, with her beside you, still wet from her misadventure and shaking from cold and shock. She made no objection when you put your arm round her, and even nestled her head on your shoulder, but there was nothing amorous about it, you were worried sick about Kate and just looking for comfort. It didn't last all that long anyway, for it was only a few minutes until the doctor came out to confirm that Kate was dead. So then you spent the next few hours talking to the police. Police Station Reception Area: The last time you were here was when the police called you in to go over your statement about Kate's drowning, just a couple of days before the Inquest at the Coroner's Court just round the corner. They seemed particularly interested in what you could tell them about Kate's state of mind, but you couldn't really add much to the statement you'd given them in the Hospital just after the event. Cornwallis Avenue Nth: You remember you had to attend the Coroner's Court after Kate drowned. It was a miserable business; the police doctor had confirmed that Kate's death was by drowning, but as you'd arrived on the scene so soon after she had fished Kate out of the river that you were an important witness. Although she (your friend, that is) said she'd seen Kate jump off the bridge, there was no suicide note and no evidence that Kate was feeling suicidal, so in the end the coroner's jury reached a verdict of death by misadventure. With the wisdom of hindsight you wish they'd been a bit more thorough and a lot more suspicious. Churchyard: Kate's grave is somewhere here among the others; you used to visit it often. You'll never forget the shock you received when you came one day only a few weeks after Kate's funeral to find the grave desecrated. At least, someone had knocked over the headstone and smashed it, and the flowers were all torn up and strewn around. The police never did catch the culprits, and put it down to local hooligans, but that never seemed quite satisfactory somehow; why should it be Kate's grave that was attacked in this way? It's long since been put right, of course, but the memory of the broken gravestone still leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Kate deserved better than that - much better. Nave: You remember when you came here for Kate's funeral, just over six years ago. She was sitting up in one of the front pews, quite unaware of your presence, although your eyes kept wandering to the back of her head. At some appropriate point in the service she went up to the lectern and made some thoroughly fitting speech about the tragically early death of her dear friend Kate, who had had a wonderful life ahead of her. You can't remember precisely what she said; what you remember is how solemn and composed she was as she spoke, saying just the right things in just the right sombre tone, without ever giving way to emotion and tears. High Street (Outside Hairdressers and Pub): You'll never forget the terrible shock you got when you happened to be passing this way not long after Kate's funeral (which had left you feeling pretty down in any case). She (not Kate - she) had stepped out of the Hairdressers, and for a moment you almost failed to recognize her, she'd had her hair cut so dreadfully short. You hated it at once; she'd had such a glorious mane of long dark hair, but this - well, it must have shown in your face, since she remarked, more than a little snippily. "I thought it was time for a change", and then stalked off up the street before you could reply. In the event she must have agreed with your judgement, though, since she never had her hair cut like that again; instead the way she let it grow longer year by year suggested she hardly had it cut again at all. photograph: It shows the climax of the graduation ceremony, with Kate shaking hands with the Vice-Chancellor as she receives the award for the best degree result of the year. A little way over to the left a group of graduands in academic robes stand looking on and applauding; among them are Jeremy, Nick, yourself - and her. It's her you look at, every bit as beautiful at twenty-one as she is today. She's applauding and smiling with the rest, but the smile looks a little forced. certificates: The certificates show a range of her achievements, but her degree certificate is conspicuous by its absence. University Hall: You attended three or four quite unmemorable lectures here when you were a student, but you mainly remember this hall for the two University rites of passage: matriculation and graduation. You can't even recall seeing her at the former, but she was definitely at the latter, and quite out of sorts that day -- you could scarcely get a cold nod out of her, let alone a word. Sports Ground: You don't come here much, sport really isn't your thing. But you did come a few times that summer, to watch the tennis tournament. She was in it. She reached the finals. You're no expert on tennis, but she seemed to be totally in control all the time; it was almost as if she were dancing round the court rather than exerting herself. She, won, of course: at least she won the women's singles, although she didn't do quite so well in the mixed doubles. When you spoke to her afterwards she seemed to be almost more preoccupied with that failure than with her success: "That idiot Nick!" she complained, "He was like an uncoordinated lobster on court! We should have won!" Concert Hall: You've attended many concerts here over the years, many of them good, but the one you remember best is the amateur performance of The Marriage of Figaro in which she sang the part of Cherubino. You thought she sang like an angel, and in your mind's ear you can still hear her beautiful rendition of the aria "Voi che sapete" - "You who know what love is". You came back to hear her again several nights in succession; it's fortunate that you're so fond of Mozart. Theatre Auditorium: Not all the events held here were as representative of high culture as the builders of this theatre might have hoped. Three or four years ago the city held a contest here to choose a beauty queen for some local pageant. Of course she was one of the contestants, and of course she won; most of the other contestants were pretty enough but next to her beauty they struck you as fireflies competing with the sun. It wasn't just a matter of her looks, though she certainly looked drop-dead gorgeous that night; at the time you imagined that she had far more poise, far more intelligence, and far more personality than the rest of them put together. Lounge Bar: You met her here about three years ago. You'd been giving her some routine legal advice on the phone, and you'd managed to drop the suggestion of a drink into the conversation. A little to your surprise she'd agreed, and that evening, you only had to wait for about five minutes before she walked in, spotted you from across the bar and came and joined you at your table. "Tell me," she said, once you'd bought her a drink and you'd both settled down for a chat, "What would you like to be remembered for?" "I'm not sure I'd ever given it much thought," you replied, "I suppose I'd be pretty content to be remembered as a decent sort of bloke." "Oh, I'm sure you'll be remembered for that, David!" she laughed, "But I've been thinking; how sad it must be to pass through life and never leave any kind of impression." "You seem to have made quite an impression round here already," you remarked. "Maybe -- but is it enough?" she wondered, "There are times when I feel that whatever I do, it's never quite enough!" "It sounds like you're demanding too much of yourself," you suggested. For a moment she stared at you, as if pondering how best to respond to this idea. Then she suddenly brightened, briskly changing the subject, "Sorry, I'm sure you don't want to hear about my existential angst all evening --  so, tell me about your day." So you did, and from there the conversation wandered on to other topics, till she quite suddenly announced that she had to leave. Mandlebury Park: When time permits you often come here to eat your lunch on the park bench. On one such occasion about four years ago you saw her jogging past on a circuit of the park. The second time round, she stopped to catch her breath and chat. You can't remember a great deal of the conversation , but you do remember she was enthusing about some book she'd just read. "Have you read any Stanilev?" she asked. "I've never heard of him," you admitted. "He's a great thinker, you should read him, you really should," she urged you, "Until I read him I never realized anyone else could feel that way. It was so liberating!" But though you promised her you'd look out for a copy of Stanilev's book, somehow you never got round to it until now. Public Library: You remember coming here about four or five years ago to borrow a novel, and seeing her sitting off to one side, concentrating on some book. You exchanged smiles, but that was about as far as you got before a frown from a fierce librarian silenced your incipient greeting. black book: The book has a plain black cover, on which is inscribed "Nightfall, by A.D. Stanilev". Art Gallery: Although art isn't really your thing, you came here about a year ago to see an exhibition of paintings entered into a competition for local amateurs. Or rather you came to see one painting in particular: her painting, the painting that won the competition. Her painting: Her painting, the winning entry, is still prominently on display. It portrays the city at sunset, with the buildings silhouetted in front of a blazing red glow. The painting is certainly striking, but you find it a little disturbing; it almost makes it look as if the whole city is on fire. The painting is called "Nightfall". You check the signature at the bottom right-hand corner, but it looks like her name, not the mysterious MASTEMA of the poster in her flat - curiouser and curiouser. Her Office: You've been here once or twice before; she's occasionally used your firm for legal advice. She set up in business here shortly after graduating, specializing in student lets. The business seems to have been moderately successful - at least, it's still going and she's not obviously poverty-stricken - but it's never grown, since she still works by herself after seven years at it. letter: It's a handwritten letter from Jeremy, dated about two years ago, breaking off his relationship with her. You re-read it, your eye stopping on phrases like, "I'm sorry, but it's over. I still find you as charming and attractive as I always did, and you can be great company, but I'm worn out by your need to always be the best at everything, and I've had enough of playing second fiddle to your ambition" and "We've had good times together, but I realize now that you're just not the woman for me" and "Even now I don't really feel I know you. I'm sure you do have a heart, but I've never felt you've ever really opened it to me; for such a successful woman you seem strangely repressed." The letter must obviously have been returned to him, since across the bottom is written in another hand: "You should have thought twice before rejecting me!" printed email: It's a printed copy of an email, addressed to her from one edward.dawlish@freegov.org. The main body of the email reads: > So I hope you will give very serious consideration to my > application to represent the party at the next general > election. We have given your CV and letter the most serious consideration but regret to inform you that we felt unable to add your name to our short-list of candidates. As I'm sure you will appreciate this has long been a safe seat, and we thus have an unusually strong field of potential candidates, many of whom already have considerable parliamentary experience. > I have been active in many aspects of local life, > and I believe this makes me uniquely well suited > to represent this community. Your participation and achievements in the life of this city have indeed been remarkable, and we recognize that. We accordingly feel you would make an *excellent* candidate for the city council, and very much hope you will consider offering yourself as a candidate for the forthcoming local elections (we could virtually guarantee to find you a winnable ward). Any experience gained as a local councillor would also stand you in very good stead should you wish to pursue parliamentary ambitions at some later date. The email is dated about two years ago. At the bottom of it is written in large red letters: "NO!". Junction of High Street and College Street: About two years ago you ran into her here as you were walking home, and she was doing the same, both of you rather later than normal. Your paths would normally have taken you in opposite directions, but instead of turning to walk down the High Street she took a detour up Hythe Bridge Street to walk along beside you. "Today has not been a good day," she explained, "I could do with seeing a friendly face!" So you walked on up Hythe Bridge Street together, but she seemed unwilling to say what was wrong. Junction of York Street and Hythe Bridge Street: About two years ago you had walked up from the other end of Hythe Bridge Street with her one evening, as she'd taken a slight detour from her normal route. You had stopped at this junction, since her way home lay south and yours lay north. It was just at this point on your walk that she came closest opening herself up to you. "Would you say I was a failure?" she asked. "Certainly not!" You declared, surprised by her question, "I've never known anyone succeed at so many things!" "But not everything," she sighed, "and maybe not at anything really important." On impulse you offered, "Shall I walk you home?" "Why not?" she replied. So you'd both headed south together, and you tried to get her to expand on what she had just said, but somehow the moment had been lost and she insisted on changing the subject. Gladstone Terrace: When you walked her home one night, about two years ago, this was as far as you got. You had hoped she would at least invite you in for a coffee. Indeed, for a moment you thought she seemed just on the point of doing so, but then all she said was, "Thank you - it was good to talk." Just before she turned away to let herself in, she added, "I'll see you around." Then she disappeared inside, leaving you standing in the street as if you could not possibly have expected anything else. Old Library Dance Floor: The last time you were here was a couple of years or so ago. You mainly recall music too loud for conversation and a floor too crowded to dance on without bumping into people at every turn; it really wasn't your scene at all. You only bought a ticket because you knew she'd be here. And so she was, effortlessly elegant in plain black, standing out from all the others in their colourful finery like a princess among apes. You kept stealing hopeful glances at her all evening. Surprisingly, for much of the time she seemed to be dancing with some nerdish-looking teenager (at the time you supposed either that she must have felt sorry for him and was just being nice, or else that he must be some cousin she'd been lumbered with for the evening). At last, when you'd given up all hope and had gone in search of a refill for your glass, she came up to you and asked you for a dance. You'd been secretly hoping for a slow romantic sway, of course, but your luck being what it was all you got was an energetic jive. At least, she was commendably energetic about it (but graceful with it, of course), which left you feeling a bit like a lumbering elephant with four left feet in comparison. But at the time you felt that one dance made the whole evening worthwhile. Morgans Bank: You ran into her here about eighteen months ago; she was just ahead of you in the queue. "Oh, hello!" she said, with one of her brighter smiles, "Are you here to take all your money out too? These people obviously can't be trusted with it!" "Why not?" you asked. "Didn't you hear about it on the news?" she replied, "Someone hacked into Morgans' mainframe and siphoned off a couple of million. Doesn't say much for their security, does it?" old newspaper: Most of it is missing, and the rest of it is at least several weeks old. Apart from the grease stains testifying to its use as a fish-and-chips wrapper, it is full of the usual bad news about undesirable things on the increase: inflation, unemployment, taxes, crime, global warming; according to one columnist, there's even a sharp rise in severe personality disorders among the under thirties. The sole surviving page of foreign news is no cheerier, since it bemoans increasing tension in the Middle East coupled with the danger of former Soviet republics selling nuclear weapons on the black market. large metal cylinder: The large metal cylinder is mostly silver in colour, and has various coloured wires attached to it. There's quite a bit of writing on it, but it's all in the Cyrillic alphabet. A quick glance at the civil defence manual does not prove reassuring -- the cylinder could well be a bomb. large poster: It's a monochrome photograph of a painting depicting sunset over the city. You recognize it as the winning entry in a recent art competition; the original hangs in the Art Gallery Market Street. The black and white photo is not nearly so striking as the oil-colour original, but perhaps the original would be too overpowering for a living room - at least you always find it a bit disturbing to look at. The photograph differs from the original in another odd way: the signature in the bottom right-hand corner should be her name, but instead it looks like MASTEMA. Supermarket: It was here that you last saw her, about ten days ago, when she came up behind you in the checkout queue. She seemed pleased to see you, and appeared to have made a deliberate choice to join your queue, but the conversation remained inconsequential until you were ready to leave. Just as you'd packed up your shopping and paid your bill, she became suddenly solemn. "If I ever needed you - I mean really needed you - you would be there for me, wouldn't you?" she asked. "Of course," you replied, without hesitation. "Good," she smiled, and then changed the subject to something inconsequential like the weather. familiar birthday card: You recognize it at once. It is the card you sent her for her birthday a few weeks ago, a safe, arty kind of card that showed you were thinking of her without suggesting anything soppy. You wonder why she kept it. Ticket Office: While you were queuing for your ticket, Jeremy turned to you and said, "She's still in the city, you know. She's not leaving; apparently there's something frantically important she has to do here." "More important than getting away from the Enemy?" you asked. "So she says," he replied, with a dismissive shrug, "Oh, and by the way, I nearly forgot. She asked me to give you this." He handed you a small brown envelope. You didn't need to ask who he meant. There were thousands of women in the city, but only one she - in Jeremy's case because of their relationship; in yours - well, it was then that your notion about staying behind for her finally started to harden into resolve. gold brooch: It's a gold brooch, in the form of a scorpion. The design is quite distinctive, and you're sure she has a brooch like that. You've often wondered what kind of statement it's meant to make: not that she's poisonous, to be sure, but you suspect she'd not be averse to suggesting she's not to be messed with.

Still, David, you stayed behind for me, and that's good because you're the only one who never rejected me, so you mustn't reject me now -- me or my nightfall." "Emma, what are you talking about?" you ask sadly. "We're about to reach Nightfall: final, ultimate, wonderful nightfall! This whole city is about to become a pile of radioactive ash!" she declares brightly, as if this were the best possible thing imaginable, "I have just detonated my bomb! At last I've achieved something that no one can ignore! This place never did value me properly, I've suffered far too many rejections! You do understand, don't you? I tried - I really tried - I always did my best, but other people kept stealing the prizes. That's why I had to kill Kate, of course - and why I have to destroy this city! Don't look so upset, David -- death is the most loving gift I have to give, and you of all people deserve my best! Just think what I'm sharing with you!

[STATE] You already have that. [ACTION] drop it [STATE] Emma looks mildly vexed, but picks up the box and hands it back to you. "Careful!" she admonishes you. [ACTION] throw it
[STATE] Emma looks mildly vexed, but picks up the box and hands it back to you. "Careful!" she admonishes you. [ACTION] throw it [STATE] Emma looks vaguely annoyed, but picks up the box and hands it back to you. "Clumsy!" she admonishes you. [ACTION] eat it
[STATE] Emma looks vaguely annoyed, but picks up the box and hands it back to you. "Clumsy!" she admonishes you. [ACTION] eat it [STATE] That's plainly inedible. [ACTION] break it
[STATE] That's plainly inedible. [ACTION] break it [STATE] You smash the box against the ground, bursting open its case. She watches bemused as you rip out its wires, and then stamp the remains of the thing underfoot. "No! No!" she cries, "What have you done? You've ruined everything! You - you of all people - you have betrayed me!" With a demented shriek, she runs off into the night, leaving you momentarily dazed and alone, until you collect yourself and hurry off after her. Please press SPACE to continue. City Centre The junction where the High Street crosses Mandlebury Road is generally reckoned to be the central point of the city. From here the High Street runs north up past your office and south towards Preston Bridge and the ring road, while Mandlebury Road runs east towards the police station and west towards the river. Most of the buildings on the junction are closed up, but the supermarket on the northeast corner is partly lit, and lights are blazing from Morgans Bank to the southwest. The night is just turning to dawn and you hear the sound of distant birdsong. Soon the city will be bustling with life once more; the bomb disposal people are already at work and it should be safe for people to start returning this afternoon. You have saved the city. You couldn't save her. You caught up with her just in time to see her throw herself into the river. You tried looking for her; you jumped in where you thought you'd seen her go under, and swam around for as long as you could, but you never found her, so eventually you gave up. Perhaps it's better that way, for now at last she is at peace. And you? You feel quite strange, as if you'd suddenly woken up on an alien world that was both like and unlike home. Your idol has been shattered: she was not what you thought; for all her brilliance and beauty, she was not worthy of the pedestal you put her on. But then, perhaps no human being should be worshipped. In any case, now she's gone you can at last move on. It's time to start living your life without her. You look around you and decide that from now on your life is probably best lived elsewhere - this city holds too many memories for you. But before you go you know there is one last task you must perform. You must put some fresh flowers on Kate's grave. *** You have won *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, see some ADDITIONAL things to try, UNDO the last turn or QUIT? [ACTION] examine her

She laughs out loud and punches the air in triumph, shouting, "Yes!" Beaming at you fondly she continues, "Dear David, I always knew you were my truest friend, the one person I could always rely on.  That's why I had to share this with you. Would you like to kiss me? Yes, I can see in your eyes you would. Go on - kiss me - I know you've always been dying to, and now you're about to die with me!" She smiles at your mild bemusement, then goes on, "I'm afraid someone tipped them all off -- I suppose it must have been Danny, he was the only one who knew enough -- so they all got away, and I really wanted to take them all with me. Still, David, you stayed behind for me, and that's good because you're the only one who never rejected me, so you mustn't reject me now -- me or my nightfall." "Emma, what are you talking about?" you ask sadly. "We're about to reach Nightfall: final, ultimate, wonderful nightfall! This whole city is about to become a pile of radioactive ash!" she declares brightly, as if this were the best possible thing imaginable, "You have just detonated my bomb, bless you! So, you deserve to share in my triumph! At last I've achieved something that no one can ignore! This place never did value me properly, I've suffered far too many rejections! You do understand, don't you? I tried - I really tried - I always did my best, but other people kept stealing the prizes. That's why I had to kill Kate, of course - and why I have to destroy this city! Don't look so upset, David -- death is the most loving gift I have to give, and you of all people deserve my best! Just think what I'm sharing with you! I know you've always fancied me, and now I know I love you madly, so go on, take me: hug me, kiss me, make mad passionate love to me; I'm yours till death us do part!" [ACTION] kill her

[ACTION] kill her [STATE] (Emma) In sudden fury, you lash out at her with your fists. She's momentarily taken off guard, so you land one punch on her jaw, but then she dodges out of your range, saying, "Really, David, that's no way for a gentleman to behave!" "Death, destruction, decay, these three things abide," she says, "but the greatest of these... Hang on. It's late!" She frowns momentarily, then relaxes into a smile, "I should not be so impatient - any moment now! Just give me one last kiss while you still can!" [ACTION] stab her with kitchen knife
