Obvious exits lead left; right, to the antechamber; forwards; and backwards, back to the infirmary. The list of exits will no longer be shown in either the status line or room description. Antechamber A long, narrow room, the walls bulging with strange pipes and machinery.  The most notable feature is the thickly armoured airlock door leading further in.  Either side of the airlock are an equipment rack and a glass tube.  A more conventional exit leads back out. On the equipment rack are a scanner, a retrieval beacon, and a launcher.  The glass tube contains an environment suit. You can go forward to the transmission chamber, or back to the complex lower level. You don the environment suit and grab your equipment. The exit slides shut and locks with a click. (first opening the exit) You change out of your environment suit and return your equipment to the racks. The exit unlocks with a click.

Why try to expose mysteries and unlock power we are unlikely to use wisely?" It is worth noting how many of these naysayers are in their thirties or forties.  How many are in their fifties, sixties or even older. Because it is precisely the drive of intelligent, questioning minds to find out what is true, how things work, to try to unravel the secrets of even something as sacred as the living body - it is precisely that drive which has enabled them to live to such a ripe old age that they can preach nostalgically about more ignorant times.

As someone with a more thorough grounding in science than art, I cannot dispute this view, much as I may feel quite the opposite.  But however unromantic the scientist's flower may be, even less appealing is the plague; the child who dies in infancy; the cry for help that travels too slow.

Clothes and books are thrown haphazardly on every surface, along with circuitboards, tools and spare parts.  Beneath all the clutter you can just make out a sofa and an aquarium. In the centre of the room is a small platform beneath a familiar-looking antenna. Dr. Sliss spins around, hands outstretched.  "Of course you're not surprised I built one in my spare time, are you?  It should be able to safely fire a couple of times.  Before blowing out power across the city." (You could ask her about the exploding collar, or her plans.) [ACTION] examine sofa
