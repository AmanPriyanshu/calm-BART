The boat lies here, but you don't have the time to set it afloat. Instead, you jump directly into the cold water, swimming a safe distance from the shore. The wolves break out of the woods but they stop at the water, howling and hissing. It seems they are afraid of it; and you swim towards the Dagon unhindered. Quickly, strong hands pull you out of the water and you are escorted into the Captain's cabin. You quickly explain what happened; and though the story doesn't even sound convincing to yourself, Captain Davids believes you. "I have heard of werewolves in these parts, but a whole village? This evil must be stopped. I have the suspicion that this shaman you spoke of is the cause of this evil... if we manage to destroy him, maybe the others will be saved, too." You nod; it didn't seem that the villagers had any idea of what was going on when they were gathered to lynch you. "I have an idea. It is very dangerous, but it might work. In my library are certain old books; and one of them describes a salve that can transform a man into a wolf for some time." You nod grimly. "Let me do it." "Ranil! It is very dangerous! If you stay in wolf-form too long, you might not be able to ever become human again; and I do not know if your strength can match that of the shaman. But I can see in your eyes that you are determined to do it, and so I shall prepare everything. "I know it is only morning, but you must go and sleep now, for you will need all your strength later. I shall wake you around midnight." Again, you nod, and leave for your hammock in the ship's hold as Davids pulls a black-bound leather tome out of his book case. You lie down and quickly fall into a troubled sleep. [Strike any key to continue...] D A Y   T H R E E [Strike any key to continue...] Shortly after midnight, Davids gently shakes you awake. "I have prepared the salve, Ranil. I have to warn you again - it is very dangerous to stay in wolf-form too long. Are you sure you really want to do this? "Yes." Davids tells you to remove your clothes, then proceeds to rub the salve into your body. "I'm afraid his is going to hurt. Here," he hands you a piece of wood, "bite down on this." At first, you feel nothing. Then, a tingle runs over your skin, and then the pain hits you. You fall to the floor, your teeth grinding into the wood, your vision dimmed. Your breath comes in short gasps, and an explosion of pain makes you pass out for a few seconds. When you can think clearly again, you open your eyes. Everything is dark, except for a large red blotch in the center of your vision. You inhale deeply and an impossible number of sensations stream from all sides. Wood, salve, clothes, skin, flesh, blood. [Strike any key to continue...] You try to rise, but find you are too weak yet. Davids quickly holds your muzzle in both hands and ties some rope around it. "Sorry, boy, but I can't have you kill anyone yet." You growl at him, but he grabs you by the nape of the neck and leads you to one of the boats. It is quickly lowered and Davids rows you over to the shore. As you jump on the beach, Davids removes the rope and quickly makes for the Dagon again. "Kill him. And be back in two hours, or it may be too late." Beach The many different scents on the beach are overwhelming, but there is one that is stronger and more evil than all the others. [ACTION] smell

[STATE] You follow the scent along the northwestern trail, but it is soon lost in the undergrowth and you are forced to return to the fork. [ACTION] northeast [STATE] Ignoring the warnings of your wolf-sense, you follow the path to the northeast. The scent intensifies, and soon you see the shape of the shaman before you. Suddenly, the feeling of danger becomes even stronger - this is too easy. There must be a trap here, somewhere. Clearing A circular clearing has been cut in the heart of the forest. The ground is even; a large stone altar stands here, covered with... stuff; you can't make anything out past the shaman's scent. The shaman stands here with his back turned to you.

[ACTION] kill shaman [STATE] You run to attack the shaman, and suddenly sky and earth swap places as you run over a certain spot, springing a hidden trap that catches you in a tight net! Smiling, the shaman turns around and motions into the woods. Ten men emerge, and you are quickly lowered to the ground and tightly wrapped up with rope. Helplessly, you growl, snarl and snap at everyone that comes too close, but the net prevents you from actually hurting someone. The shaman begins stroking your fur, talking all the time, and irritation soon turns to pleasure. After an hour, you have forgotten any ties to your former human existence. The shaman orders the villagers to release you and offers you a large, bloody steak; you greedily devour it, then lay contentedly at the heel of your new master. *** You have failed *** ?
