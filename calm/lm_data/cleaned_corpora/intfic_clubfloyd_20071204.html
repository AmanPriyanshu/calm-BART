[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. Dear Blogreaders, yesterday was the strangest day of my life! The things I have seen - and done - it was so strange...so horrible. And yet, wonderful. You remember that guy from the Psychology course? Paul? We had a date the day before yesterday. Some people already emailed me with questions regarding how it went. But sorry, especially to you, Toby43, but I was to tired, and, honestly, to drunk to go online that night. I'll skip that part, maybe I'll write about it later, because I have to tell you what went down this night. Paul was throwing this big New-Years-Eve party and he invited me (of course, I may add with what little self-esteem I have), to help him organize - and stay overnight. That's how it all started. I arrived in the midst of the party, because I was visiting my family before that. So when I went in the door, Paul rushed at me. I couldn't have anticipated what happened next, that this would turn into... The Day I shot Hitler An interactive Party by Taleslinger  Paul, his brown hair in a cute pony-tail, rushes at you, a huge bowl of eggnog in his hand. He told you yesterday that he prepared it carefully after some old family recipe. He looks at you in utter horror, squeaking: "Mice." "Of me to drop by?" "No, Mice. They were in the house yesterday, and now one is in my eggnog." His voice is but a whisper. "Hm, throw it away?" you suggest carefully. "No, Alex, everyone is waiting for it. Also, the noodles haven't arrived yet and the sandwiches are disappearing rapidly.So people need something to feed on." Right at that moment, the head of a small mouse pokes out of the liquid. The little bugger looks around, then begins to swim around quite happily. "Get rid of these foul vermin! Save my eggnog." You both look down on the swimming mouse. "And please don't hurt the poor little creature." With that, Paul disappears into the living room, leaving the bowl in your hands. hallway A small hallway, brightly lit by a row of neon lights. Dark wooden stairs lead upwards, and a doorframe opens west into the Living Room. A small door under the stairs lead into a storage closet. (Referred to by Paul only as "The Potter Room".) Your steps don't make any sound on the the thick, red carpet. You can see a chest of drawers (closed) here. [ACTION] inventory

Suddenly, there is a commotion in the house. Paul stumbles out of the glass doors, face pale. "It's Hubert" he says, biting his lip. "Hubert?" "A German exchange guy I dated last year. Liked his accent. Anyway, I dumped him when I found out he was here to lead a camp of militant Nazi.("Hey" you mutter absent-mindedly. "Hobson's Law.") He didn't like that to well.  Now he's over there, stone drunk. Dressed like Hitler (must've mixed up New Years Eve and Halloween, oh these Eurotrash guys) and waving a piece around. Looks like he thinks those people in there are his hostages, and he will kill them If I don't surrender myself to him. I'm glad all those folks in there seem to be a bit too stoned to realize what's happening." He fondles your hair and breathes into your ear. "Could you look into it?" You smirk. "What? After realizing you dated a Nazi?" Paul leaves a trail of laughter, as he disappears to some other part of the -y. Garden Area Pauls Parents are rather fond of this small pool. It's surrounded by some deck-chairs. The eastern and western garden walls are overgrown with undergrowth, so as to hide the family members going for a seamelss tan. This wasn't necessary for the southern wall, wich is quite high, because it borders on a Golf course (Pauls told you they find the occasional golf ball in the pool nonetheless.) A small flock of people is lying around in the deck-chairs, most of them still dressed, waving drinks and mumbling to each other in the afternoon glow. You can also see an Uzi here. [ACTION] take uzi

You'd like to avoid any collateral damage, however, so unless you can think of a way to keep people away from the hors d'oeuvres table, your best bet might just be to make the mouse bite him.  How to do that - especially without getting bit in the process - is something you have yet to figure out.  Perhaps you can put the mouse down the front of his trousers or something.

SpeedIFs are intentionally written in a very short period of time; the "rule" used to be that you wrote a SpeedIF in two hours or less, but that is a rule to which few coders actually adhere.  This game was written in about twelve hours, though honestly quite a bit of that time was spent relearning how to code. This game was written for New Year's Speed, a SpeedIF that was coordinated to coincide with the last weekend in 2007.  The premise of this particular SpeedIF is as follows: Write a New Year's-themed speed IF which incorporates eggnog spiked with mice, a party crashed by Adolf Hitler, and a resolution to lazily masticate all sandwiches.  Extra props for including a swanky, benoodled golf cart. Silliness ensues.  I hope you enjoy it, though.
