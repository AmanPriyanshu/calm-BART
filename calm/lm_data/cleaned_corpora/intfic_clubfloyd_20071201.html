[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] As an aspiring groom in Lord Bellwater's household, recklessness has not been one of the qualities for which you, Bert Smith, would wish to be noted. However, desperate times call for desperate measures, and here you are in the early hours of the morning of Saturday 20th June 1863, undertaking the most reckless venture of your life. Instead of retiring to your bed, in your lodgings in the mews at the back of Lord Bellwater's town house, you sneaked into the house and hid in the cellar until the household had gone to bed. You sidled into the butler's pantry and took the key to the master's study and now find yourself creeping about like a common thief. You hear the clock in the hall strike one o'clock as you carefully pull the study door closed behind you. Please press SPACE to continue. Lord Bellwater's Secret  Lord Bellwater's study The study is a well-proportioned, rectangular room. The door, of finely polished oak, leads back onto the landing, to the west; a broad sash window in the opposite wall looks out over Cadogan Square. The heavy velvet curtains are drawn back and a pale moonlight falls into the room, illuminating a heavy mahogany desk in its centre. To the right of the window is a small table. On the north side of the room is a stone fireplace with a dull red glow still coming from the remains of the coals, burning among the ashes: a shadowy oil painting hangs above it. To the left of the fireplace is a wooden stand, supporting an ornate porcelain pot, in which a leafy plant is growing. The south wall is covered, floor to ceiling, with bookshelves, laden with hundreds, if not thousands, of leather-bound volumes, in neat rows. [ACTION] inventory

We reported yesterday that Sir Archibald's will (in which he divided his entire estate between his housekeeper and his favourite horse) was being contested by his eldest son, the Honourable Percy Ramswell, who was not mentioned in the will. After due consideration, the judge (Mr Justice Williams) has now delivered his judgement. In summary, he has stated that under English law, a man may leave his property to any living person and is certainly under no obligation to leave anything to his children if he does not wish to do so. However, a horse is not a living person and is ineligible to be a beneficiary of a will. His ruling is therefore that in this case, the entire estate is to be given to the only living person mentioned in the will, namely the housekeeper. The judge informed the housekeeper that she is entitled to use her newly-acquired fortune as she wishes, but that she might see fit to make arrangements for the comfort of the horse. This comment caused a ripple of mirth in the courtroom, shared by all except The Honourable Percy Ramswell. On a separate legal point which had been raised on behalf of Sir Archibald's son, the judge ruled that the naming of a horse in one's will was not, in itself, evidence of insaninty, and that the terms of the will could not be contested on those grounds. "If everyone who preferred their horse to their son was to be certified insane," declared Judge Williams, "There should not be asylums enough to house them all." The article has been ringed with green ink and a handwritten note in the margin reads "Capital idea. Maybe leave everything to a horse rather than to James!" [ACTION] spin dial

He said you will get a lot of mony when he died. But the new lord B. is very angery about it. I dont now why he is angery with me but i fear he means to do me harm. If you are to get some mony maybe we can get marrid and I can give my notis to leave. I am a bit afrayd of new lord B. Try to meet me in the... At this point there is a heavy mark as though the pencil broke and, although there are some scratch marks, as though the writer tried to continue, nothing further can be read. [ACTION] examine crisp paper [STATE] You reach out and take the sheet of crisp cream paper. You examine the paper - it is a letter. You read it: Purdy and Jowett (Solicitors) 3 Holborn Court London WC 16th June 1863 Personal and in confidence Dear James We talked last night over a few brandies at your club about your father's last will and testament. As we discussed, he asked me to draw up a new (and rather surprising) will, shortly before his sad decease. As I indicated to you, the will was properly drawn up by myself, was signed by your father and was witnessed by his butler and one of his chambermaids. There were two copies, one of which was kept by your father (and therefore came into your possession, as you explained to me) and the other retained by me as an office copy. This new will revoked your father's previous will, made some years ago, in which he had left everything to yourself. You have made a strong case to me that your father was losing his mind towards the end of his final illness and that this new will was therefore invalid. I have to say that I saw no sign of your father's loss of mental powers when I was with him, but I accept that you have been a good deal closer to him than me and that you are better placed to make that judgement. I also accept that some of the wording of the will could be taken to indicate an unbalanced mind. I fully understand your reluctance to challenge the will through the legal process, which would require giving evidence in court of your father's worsening mental state. I appreciate that you do not wish to dishonour his memory by dragging these details through the courts. In view of all the above considerations I have decided to accept your account of your father's dementure and that it will be for the best for us to destroy all copies of the recent will and to abide by the terms of the earlier will. I therefore enclose the office copy of the recent will and leave it for you to dispose of it as you see fit. I have no further record of the will and will treat its existence as a matter of client confidentiality between the two of us. You also mentioned to me that you have some sort of hold over the butler which will guarantee his absolute silence and loyalty. However, I am more concerned about the an unhappy "accident", which occurred to the chambermaid, who was the other witness to the will. You indicated that her fortuitous death was not quite so accidental as you would like people to believe. I cannot help but draw the conclusion that you had some part in her death. Whilst I would find such behaviour personally unacceptable, I shall, of course, be bound by my professional confidentiality in my dealings with you as a client. On a separate matter, you kindly mentioned in our conversation that I have performed a great many services for your family over the years, often without any direct remuneration from your father and that you intended to pay me a modest sum in recompense for these services. I think you mentioned a sum in the region of 5000 pounds, which I consider to be most generous and look forward to receiving. Yours sincerely Roger Jowett Your solicitor and loyal friend. Although this letter makes mention of an enclosed copy of a will, there is nothing of that sort attached to the letter. [ACTION] take pocketbook

I have decided not to destroy the two copies immediately but I have put them where they cannot be found. I have also placed your letter in an extremely safe place. That, too, I am keeping, just in case you should get cold feet about our arrangement. I believe that what we have done is honest and reasonable but, if you should suddenly decide to view it otherwise, the letter would make your part very plain. Once the formalities have been completed for my inheritance and assuming that goes unchallenged, I shall destroy both the letter and the copies of the will. Regarding my part in the death of the servant, I have to inform you that you are much mistaken. A rogue and a cad I may be, but a murderer I am not. Indeed I fear I may have given you too much of my favourite brandy on Monday evening, leaving you not quite in command of your senses. In case you doubt my veracity, the exact situation is that I entered my study to see Dewhurst, my butler trying to force his attentions on the girl. He had his back to me and didn't see me enter the room. The girl was struggling to get away from him and he seemed to lose his temper and giver her an almightly shove. She fell back against the open window and toppled over the sill. I was very consoling to poor Dewhurst and agreed that I would not call in the police, so long as he signed a confession, on the undertanding that if I am completely satisfied with his service for the next five years, I shall destroy the confession. With regard to the other matter that you mention, as soon as I have received the benefit of my inheritance, I shall be in a position to pay you for the past services that we discussed. The sum you mentioned would indeed be generous but I think I can offer something approaching that amount. Yours sincererly James. [ACTION] take notepaper

I, Robert William Dewhurst do make this sworn statement to Lord James Bellwater. On 15th June 1863, I came into my Lord's private study, where I found Elsie Browning, a female servant, polishing the windows. I have long held an affection for this girl and I tried to press my attentions on her. She struggled in my arms and I thought she was teasing me and I was all the more keen to embrace her. However, she then proceeded to slap my face, at which point I lost my temper and pushed her away from me. I did not know my own strength and she fell back, against the open window with such force that she lost her balance and fell out. I was filled with remorse and ran downstairs and out of the door to the front steps where she had landed, but it was all in vain, for she was quite dead from the fall. Signed R. Dewhurst.

Please press SPACE to continue. Some weeks later, the following item appears in "The Times": Today at the Old Bailey was concluded the trial which has been called (in the more "popular" press) the "Bellwater burglary case". The curious background to this case is that in the early hours of 20th June a groom, then in the service of Lord James Bellwater, was discovered in his employer's study, in the act of stealing papers and a substantial sum of money from a safe. During the ensuing trial, the groom, by the name of Smith, has made repeated allegations that a murder had been committed in Lord Bellwater's household and that his employer was trying to subvert the intentions of his late father's will.  The trial of Smith has created a degree of public interest because Lord Bellwater himself appeared as a witness for the prosecution: despite his many business comittments and his recent bereavement (the previous Lord Bellwater having passed away a few days before the events of the case), Lord Bellwater stated that he must "do his public duty as a witness and ensure that justice is done". After retiring for just fifteen minutes, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Smith. In sentencing, the Judge spoke out strongly against this servant who has breached the trust of the noble family of Bellwater. Smith is to be transported, for life, to the penal colony in Western Australia. *** The End *** ? [ACTION] tear curtains

Some weeks later, the following item appears in "The Times": Today at the Old Bailey was concluded the trial which has been called (in the more "popular" press) the "Bellwater burglary case". The curious background to this case is that in the early hours of 20th June a groom, then in the service of Lord James Bellwater, presented himself at Scotland yard, claiming that a murder had been committed and making accusations against his employer. The groom, by the name of Smith, produced a number of documents which he claimed to be "evidence" against those whom he accused. Our trusty police force quickly ascertained that the documents in question had been stolen from Lord Bellwater  and, on further examination of Smith, it was discovered that he was in possession of some one hundred pounds, in coins, stolen from his master's safe.  The trial of Smith created a degree of public interest because Lord Bellwater himself appeared as a witness for the prosecution: despite his many business comittments and his recent bereavement (the previous Lord Bellwater having passed away a few days before the events of the case), Lord Bellwater stated that he must "do his public duty as a witness and ensure that justice is done". After retiring for just fifteen minutes, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Smith. In sentencing, the Judge spoke out strongly against this servant who has breached the trust of the noble family of Bellwater. Smith is to be transported, for life, to the penal colony in Western Australia. *** The End *** ? [ACTION] put money in safe

Some weeks later, the following item appears in "The Times": Today at the Old Bailey was concluded the trial which has been called (in the more "popular" press) the "Bellwater murder case". Mr George Dewhurst, a butler in the household of Lord Bellwater was charged with the unlawful killing of a house servant, Elsie Browning. The main evidence against Dewhurst was provided by a groom in Lord Bellwater's household, named Bert Smith, who presented himself at Scotland Yard, in the early hours of a day in June this year, with several documents which pointed to Dewhurst's having committed the crime. After retiring for a short time, the jury found Dewhurst guilty of manslaughter and the judge sentenced him  to be transported, for life, to the penal colony in Western Australia. The case has raised considerable public attention, not only because the crime took place in the household of a noble lord, but also because of some of the surprising allegations (not directly related to the case) that have been made by the groom, Bert Smith. In particular, Smith has claimed that he is himself the lawful beneficiary of the will of the late Lord Horace Bellwater - a claim ridiculed by the present Lord Bellwater and effectively silenced by a sworn affidavit by the Bellwaters' family solicitor, Roger Jowett Esq, who has declared the supposed will to be a forgery. We understand that one of the "popular" newspapers, the "Daily News" has championed the cause of Bert Smith, and during the course of the trial, it has been raising a public subscription, amongst its readership, for the benefit of Smith. A considerable sum has been raised, providing Smith with the capital to start his own business, running a livery stable. In an extraordinary gesture of generosity, and as a personal contribution to this new business venture, it is understood that Lord James Bellwater has presented Smith with the late Lord Bellwater's horse. *** The End *** ?

You read it: Purdy and Jowett (Solicitors) 3 Holborn Court London WC 16th June 1863 Personal and in confidence Dear James We talked last night over a few brandies at your club about your father's last will and testament. As we discussed, he asked me to draw up a new (and rather surprising) will, shortly before his sad decease. As I indicated to you, the will was properly drawn up by myself, was signed by your father and was witnessed by his butler and one of his chambermaids. There were two copies, one of which was kept by your father (and therefore came into your possession, as you explained to me) and the other retained by me as an office copy. This new will revoked your father's previous will, made some years ago, in which he had left everything to yourself. You have made a strong case to me that your father was losing his mind towards the end of his final illness and that this new will was therefore invalid. I have to say that I saw no sign of your father's loss of mental powers when I was with him, but I accept that you have been a good deal closer to him than me and that you are better placed to make that judgement. I also accept that some of the wording of the will could be taken to indicate an unbalanced mind. I fully understand your reluctance to challenge the will through the legal process, which would require giving evidence in court of your father's worsening mental state. I appreciate that you do not wish to dishonour his memory by dragging these details through the courts. In view of all the above considerations I have decided to accept your account of your father's dementure and that it will be for the best for us to destroy all copies of the recent will and to abide by the terms of the earlier will. I therefore enclose the office copy of the recent will and leave it for you to dispose of it as you see fit. I have no further record of the will and will treat its existence as a matter of client confidentiality between the two of us. You also mentioned to me that you have some sort of hold over the butler which will guarantee his absolute silence and loyalty. However, I am more concerned about the an unhappy "accident", which occurred to the chambermaid, who was the other witness to the will. You indicated that her fortuitous death was not quite so accidental as you would like people to believe. I cannot help but draw the conclusion that you had some part in her death. Whilst I would find such behaviour personally unacceptable, I shall, of course, be bound by my professional confidentiality in my dealings with you as a client. On a separate matter, you kindly mentioned in our conversation that I have performed a great many services for your family over the years, often without any direct remuneration from your father and that you intended to pay me a modest sum in recompense for these services. I think you mentioned a sum in the region of 5000 pounds, which I consider to be most generous and look forward to receiving. Yours sincerely Roger Jowett Your solicitor and loyal friend.

However, I am more concerned about the an unhappy "accident", which occurred to the chambermaid, who was the other witness to the will. You indicated that her fortuitous death was not quite so accidental as you would like people to believe. I cannot help but draw the conclusion that you had some part in her death. Whilst I would find such behaviour personally unacceptable, I shall, of course, be bound by my professional confidentiality in my dealings with you as a client. On a separate matter, you kindly mentioned in our conversation that I have performed a great many services for your family over the years, often without any direct remuneration from your father and that you intended to pay me a modest sum in recompense for these services. I think you mentioned a sum in the region of 5000 pounds, which I consider to be most generous and look forward to receiving. Yours sincerely Roger Jowett Your solicitor and loyal friend. Although this letter makes mention of an enclosed copy of a will, there is nothing of that sort attached to the letter. You hear a shout from somewhere in the depths of the house.

[ACTION] read book [STATE] (the leather-bound diary) You examine the book. It seems to be a desk diary for the previous year. You flick through and notice that there are occasional entries in it, written in a distinctive, rather scholarly handwriting, and using green ink. The entries all seem to be mundane notes of when bills were paid. You pause for a moment at the entry for Tuesday 21st October 1862, which is heavily ringed in green ink, then you remember, this was old Lord Bellwater's birthday - he always gave each of the servants sixpence on this day. You hear the sound of approaching footsteps outside the door. [ACTION] inventory

[ACTION] examine ink [STATE] As an aspiring groom in Lord Bellwater's household, recklessness has not been one of the qualities for which you, Bert Smith, would wish to be noted. However, desperate times call for desperate measures, and here you are in the early hours of the morning of Saturday 20th June 1863, undertaking the most reckless venture of your life. Instead of retiring to your bed, in your lodgings in the mews at the back of Lord Bellwater's town house, you sneaked into the house and hid in the cellar until the household had gone to bed. You sidled into the butler's pantry and took the key to the master's study and now find yourself creeping about like a common thief. You hear the clock in the hall strike one o'clock as you carefully pull the study door closed behind you. Please press SPACE to continue. Lord Bellwater's Secret  Lord Bellwater's study The study is a well-proportioned, rectangular room. The door, of finely polished oak, leads back onto the landing, to the west; a broad sash window in the opposite wall looks out over Cadogan Square. The heavy velvet curtains are drawn back and a pale moonlight falls into the room, illuminating a heavy mahogany desk in its centre. To the right of the window is a small table. On the north side of the room is a stone fireplace with a dull red glow still coming from the remains of the coals, burning among the ashes: a shadowy oil painting hangs above it. To the left of the fireplace is a wooden stand, supporting an ornate porcelain pot, in which a leafy plant is growing. The south wall is covered, floor to ceiling, with bookshelves, laden with hundreds, if not thousands, of leather-bound volumes, in neat rows. [ACTION] examine ink
