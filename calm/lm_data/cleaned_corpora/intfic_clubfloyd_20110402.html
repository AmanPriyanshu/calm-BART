[STATE] Temple of Justice Glorious. If only you could build something this grand in Newtown; but there's little need to mete out the King's justice there. Since it's the off-season, the throne, altar, iron maiden, and other implements of justice have been removed for maintainence, but the majesty of the vaulted ceiling still shines through nearly as well. Against the back wall of the temple is a glowing magic field. In the magic field is a pair of wooden hooks (on which is a copper pole). Peeress Dwojadsa and several guards arrive. [ACTION] examine pole [STATE] A long, copper, rune-covered pole with a mechanical claw mounted atop. The bottom is capped with a dial. [ACTION] get pole

[STATE] Do you want to play as an [a]dventurer, an [e]nchanter, a [t]hief, [r]oyalty, or a [d]ragon? r [ACTION] m [STATE] Do you want this character to be [m]ale or [f]emale? Royalty: Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. The peasantry do love to forget a title and pretend a hero is one of theirs. Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be yours for everyone to covet. Of course, it is your name on the royal decrees, your face on the coins, and your pick of the Royal Jewels for your costume each day. But you detect an honesty in the grotesque admiration for the Baron--one you'll not find in the simpering toadies who serve you. But no. No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. The things you did then--the life you abandoned--all small prices to have paid for the luxurious lifestyle you've gained. But now... the winds bring rumor that Ventillado means to give the Gem to Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those of Thorn's Companions who survived. Thankfully, Ventillado is said to be a loyal citizen of the crown. And you can afford to be generous in recompense. The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands? Get it in yours.
