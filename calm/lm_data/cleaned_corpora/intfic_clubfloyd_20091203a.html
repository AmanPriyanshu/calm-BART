[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. Ah!  The life of an Argonaut! Adventure on the high seas!  The quest for the Golden Fleece! Of course, you get queasy just visiting the baths, and you really don't think you and the boys have a shot in Hades of ever laying eyes on that Fleece, but it was either this or stay home and continue to herd sheep, so you signed up. Once you got over the initial sea sickness, it wasn't all that bad. Your first stop, at Lemnos, lasted a year, and there were some major smoochies during that tenure.  You were just beginning to think you'd made the right choice when the boss went and uprooted everybody for the next port. The boss, Jason... enh.  He's a good enough guy.  He means well and all, and it's not exactly like he *chose* to come on this stupid quest any more than you did, but after having some of your buddies slaughtered in the night on the island of the Mount of Bears and Hercules losing his little lover boy at Mysia, you're beginning to have second thoughts. Then came this latest port: the land of the Bebrycians.  The ruler here, King Amycus, seems to think he's the Heavyweight Champion of Mt. Olympus or something.  He won't let any of you leave the island before you have a little boxing match with him.  You were really thinking that your buddy Polydeuces the Argonaut would take him on, but Polydeuces had some business off in the bushes and the King just wouldn't wait... the next thing you knew, a couple of pretty little ladies were strapping ox-hide boxing gloves on your hands and you were in the ring with Mohammed Aliamycus.
