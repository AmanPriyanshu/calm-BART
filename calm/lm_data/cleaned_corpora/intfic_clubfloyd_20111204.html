[STATE] Santa's Workshop A small army of animatronic elves work jerkily amidst an array of chugging and clanking toy producing machines. Dressed in festive red and green aprons, clenching mallets and bellows and hand-powered drills, they are Santa's sweatshop workforce (although you wonder how much sweating one does at the North Pole, and then remind yourself that these are animatronic elves who wouldn't sweat anyhow). A string of Christmas lights extends from a power outlet in the hedge wall, trails across the floor of the workshop, and disappears into the cluster of machines. Off to the side, a lone robotic elf stands at a tall desk working busily. You can also see a red twinkle light here. [ACTION] east [STATE] Somewhere in Santaland You are at the intersection of several snowy, narrow passages. From here, pathways lead to the west (back to Santa's workshop), the south (back to the room with the silver panel), and the north (back to Santa's chair and its trap door). [ACTION] north

[ACTION] north [STATE] Pictures With Santa The heart of Santaland and the destination of families from miles around. It's not your destination, of course, but that doesn't change the fact that parents and children have for years made pilgrimages to this spot to have their pictures taken with Santa Claus. Santa's big comfy chair stands in the center of the room. It's a dramatic affair, a throne really: lots of ostentatious gold-painted filigree and red velvet pillows. Next to Santa's chair is a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. There are no presents beneath the tree, perhaps to better display the colorful decorative tree skirt underneath which was, until recently, spread out beneath it. [ACTION] open chair

[ACTION] east [STATE] Depot Here kids can (beg their parents to) pay an additional $5 to have their picture taken aboard the H&O; Railroad. In other malls, you recall seeing Santaland setups with working trains chugging along through their little Santa-scapes, but this one seems much less elaborate. In the hedge wall to the south stands the stony arch of a tunnel. From the tunnel emerges a narrow set of train tracks. The tracks run north across the turf and slip under a closed door in the hedge. The brightly-colored locomotive sits on the tracks. The facade of a little ticket booth stands next to the tunnel. [ACTION] east
