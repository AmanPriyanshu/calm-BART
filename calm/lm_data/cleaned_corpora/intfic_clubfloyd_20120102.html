[ACTION] southeast [STATE] You stumble upon the beach, warm water lapping at your soaked khakis. The figure is indeed Paul. You kneel beside him and gently turn him over. He looks a little worse for wear, but still very much alive. You put a hand on his heart and feel it flutter. Better do some mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, just to be sure. As you come back up, having checked if his tongue is okay in the process, some shadows fall upon you. You look up and see yourself surrounded by a group of well-armed sharkmen. Mensharks? You are aware of neither the scientific possibility of there being a tribe of undiscovered sharkmen, nor the politically correct term for them. As you  sit there, gaping at them, quite aware you are staring, another person comes from their lines. It's a creature in a robe with tentacles for a face, but her commanding voice is clearly female: "Get the cute one. Kill the other." Having no illusions about your looks, you get ready to take a few of them with you. So you stand up and read your wit. A group of them, lead by the tentacle-faced lady, leave with an unconscious Paul carried between them. There is a moment of silence, with only the lapping of the  waves as sound. You never knew there could be uncomfortable silence with a bunch of people about to kill you, but there you have it. Finally you realize they're looking behind you, and as you turn, one swipe from the kraken hurls you screaming into the air.

I know a place for creatures like you. Come with me and visit my friend Vest, he'll help you." The kraken nods it's head and follows Robb into the golden crack, but not before punching a hole into the wall, followed by a meaningful look towards you.

[STATE] (opening the door) (unlocking the door) As you push the door open and enter, you stop for a moment to look at the knocker. Who knows why, for you see it every day -- morning and evening, and it is unremarkable enough. But you can't forget how, on this very evening a decade ago, you saw it transformed into the very image of your late partner Jacob Marley: the first of the very strange and disconcerting events of that wonderfully disconcerting night. So you glance at the knocker now, and you are shocked to see it, again, assume a once-familiar appearance. But this time the face is not Marley's, but almost your own, though one you have not seen for twenty, even thirty, years. It is the face of your brother, Mordecai. Shivering slightly (whether from the cold, or the disconcerting behaviour of your door knocker, you could not say) you go through the door, light the candle that stands ready on the hall table, lock the door carefully behind you and climb the wide staircase to your chamber. Bedroom A leopard never quite changes its spots, and your bedroom is still plain by most standards, but that is how you like it. Nevertheless, you allow yourself a few hints of comfort if not luxury. The heavy green brocade curtains are closed. Your table has a few papers on it. Your bed is ready for you. The door, leading east, is closed.

One branch of the family, the one spreading from Vittorio, the big one. He's brother to Vincente, the one Zachary must have put to rest these days. You stare at the pic, and a whole new world opens before you, while the old one opens below. The little kid, on a three wheeler. His eyes. That uncomfortable flock, which never stood where it should. And that t-shirt, with Pagliacci on it, the famous clown. "Hey, Clown", you hear Tony and Johnny call you, in your head. And all of a sudden, darkness enters the room.

The wallpaper is old and scratched, pieces of it ripped aside like thorn skin. The place is very different from the rest of the affluent mansion.

[STATE] You unlock the bulky door. [ACTION] open bulky door [STATE] You open the door. It gives with a nasty squeak. Halfway through its course it slams wide open, the young woman behind pushing it with all her strength. "Cesco!" she shouts, as she sees you. "I knew you were not dead. I knew God would answer my plea!" That said, she hugs you, trembling frantically. You let her do it, then slowly recede, looking into her eyes. "What has happened," you ask. "And why do you say you are my cousin?" "Because you are, Cesco." The last of the pictures in the album you found in the safe flashes in front of you. You can't fool yourself anymore. "I thought they killed you. How did they keep you secret, all these years?" "I was... in the house," you blush. Yes: for the last fourteen years, you were allowed to leave the mansion only once, and that was for taking your First Eucharist. That was going to be Hellen's same fate, if only you decided to stay upstairs, where you were supposed to stay. "Let's leave," you murmur, before grabbing Hellen by an arm and start rushing to the stairs. All my life, you think. I've been a convict all my goddamn life. You are still repeating the same thought, over and over, when you run through the corridors of the mansion. The same thought when you bang the front door and bathe in the winter's light. The same thought when Zachary, who was waiting for you outside, point his gun to your face. More than two hours later, it's still the same thought that accompanies you in your last, living day.

[ACTION] inventory [STATE] You're carrying nothing. You are wearing your pants. The second wire is plugged on your other nipple. A whitening noise fills your ears and eyes as the electrical storm passes through you. It never ends: the holy daggers of the tempest cut through you for ages. You resist how much you can, then the screaming starts. You are about to surrender to the night when the wire is removed. It takes you a full minute to recover. When you are fully awake, you notice a small river of blood dripping from your left breastplate. [ACTION] wait
