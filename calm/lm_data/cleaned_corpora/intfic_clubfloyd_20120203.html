Allow me to demonstrate with a vignette from your future. (press any key) Daytona Beach, Florida, 1929.  You're forty now.  Aside from a handful of appearances in a Yankee uniform a few years ago, you've been retired from the game for about nine years.  All told, you had a pretty good career.  Lifetime batting average of .273, 61 home runs in the dead ball era, good defense, and five World Series appearances (all losses, unfortunately).  Still, no one remembers any of that.  What they remember, and what they never, ever let you forget, is the ninth inning on September 23, 1908. After enough abuse to last many lifetimes, you move down here with Ethel to become an anonymous citrus grower.  But you still love the game, even if it made you a national laughingstock, so you reluctantly agree to manage the local minor-league club.  It doesn't last long. "I don't need Fred Merkle the Bonehead to teach me how to pitch!", yells your own pitcher, when you lift him after a mediocre outing.  The words reverberate around the sparsely-attended park.  The guy in the back row must have heard it. It's about the millionth time someone has called you a bonehead in the last twenty years.  You'd think by now that either they'd be tired of it, or that you'd be used to it.  Somehow, neither has happened. Wherever you go, whatever you do, it is always with you.  In the Baseball Encyclopedia, Ty Cobb's entry lists his nickname as "The Georgia Peach."  Walter Johnson's says "The Big Train."  Care to guess what yours says, Fred?

[ACTION] go to first base [STATE] You probably want to listen to this. The Pitcher's Mound This is the pitcher's mound.  It rises to a height of about fifteen inches to give the pitcher a better angle from which to throw.  In the old days, the hurler had a chalk-outlined box on level ground, and could throw the ball from anywhere inside that area.  (Thus the expression, "knocked out of the box", when a pitcher is hit hard by the opposing team.)  Nowadays the pitcher must throw from the pitching rubber. Home plate is west; second base is east; first base is south; and third base is north. You can see a rosin bag here. Bresnahan wraps things up.  "OK, everyone know what they're doing?" The other fellows all nod their assent.  Bresnahan heads back behind the plate, and Matty gives you a quick wink.  The other infielders, including you, move back to their original positions. First Base You stand a few steps behind and to the right of first base, wearing your glove, and ready to field your position should the ball come your way.  Matty is on the mound, looking in at Bresnahan behind the plate. To your right is Buck Herzog, the second baseman.  The cranks along the first base line are almost close enough to touch.  They're certainly close enough to hear. Johnny Kling is here, taking a short lead off first base. Matty steps on the rubber.  He looks in at Bresnahan, who flashes the signs.  Matty nods, and sets.  He gives a quick look back at Kling, to make sure he's not taking a big lead.  Then he begins his windup. Pfiester starts to square around to bunt, holding his bat right out in front of him to deaden the ball. [ACTION] wait

Looks like you've covering first base after all.  Kling takes off for second, and Pfiester heads to first, disgusted.  Instead of a sacrifice bunt, it's looking like a double play.

Fortunately, you're not injured, just a little embarrassed, but it was an awkward play to begin with, and to most observers, it looked as if you were trying to avoid being run over by Pfiester while tagging him. Bridwell gets most of the blame for his errant throw.

Quickly, you sweep your glove around, and barely graze a loose bit of the Giant Killer's jersey as he ducks to avoid your tag.  The umpire Bob Emslie saw it clear as day, though.  He makes a tagging motion with his arms, and yells "You're out!".  The crowd erupts in sustained cheers for a thrilling double play.  Matty turns to you and points, as if to say, Great play, Fred. (press any key) You know, Fred, I admire your moxie.  Obstacle after obstacle in your way, and you've cleared them all.  But I've been trying to tell you, this isn't going to end well if you insist on trying to win. Let me make it perfectly clear.  Your name becomes a verb in the sports pages for the next few decades.  "To Merkle" means to make a colossal blunder.  "Merkle's Boner" will be perhaps the most infamous play in baseball history, at least until someone else screws up as badly.  You already know about your common sobriquet.  Not a game will go by for the rest of your career without your hearing it from someone.  To avoid having your tombstone defaced with "Bonehead," as it surely would be, you will be buried in an unmarked grave.  I am not joking, Fred. You've got one more chance to avoid this. (press any key) Into the bottom of the ninth inning, with the score still knotted: Cubs 1, Giants 1.  Cy Seymour, the Giants' center fielder, leads off the inning by grounding out to second base: Evers to Chance.  Art Devlin follows with a single off Pfiester to center field.  Moose McCormick, your left fielder, hits a ground ball to Evers, who throws over to Tinker at second base to put out Devlin.  McCormick is at first, with two outs.  Batting next for New York: Fred Merkle. The Polo Grounds crowd have risen to their feet in anticipation.  You stand in the batter's box, bat in hand.  Sixty feet, six inches away, Jack Pfiester glares in at Johnny Kling, getting the signs and twirling the ball in his left hand.  Umpire Hank O'Day crouches behind Kling. Out of the corner of your eye, you see Moose McCormick take his lead off of first base. (press any key) Home Plate Though the bugs are screaming, and there's a runner on first, and a dugout full of teammates cheering you on, and two umpires and eight other Cubs arrayed in front of you, your field of vision is narrowed to the one man on the hill.  It's just you and Jack. Pfiester winds up.  During his windup, you can see that he is grasping the ball with two fingers spread out on top of the ball and his thumb tucked underneath.  The pitch tails away to the outer half of the plate, with tight backspin. +---------+ | Part IV | +---------+ [ACTION] swing early to the opposite field
[STATE] You catch the throw from Bridwell just as Pfiester arrives.  Quickly, you sweep your glove around, and barely graze a loose bit of the Giant Killer's jersey as he ducks to avoid your tag.  The umpire Bob Emslie saw it clear as day, though.  He makes a tagging motion with his arms, and yells "You're out!".  The crowd erupts in sustained cheers for a thrilling double play.  Matty turns to you and points, as if to say, Great play, Fred. (press any key) You know, Fred, I admire your moxie.  Obstacle after obstacle in your way, and you've cleared them all.  But I've been trying to tell you, this isn't going to end well if you insist on trying to win. Let me make it perfectly clear.  Your name becomes a verb in the sports pages for the next few decades.  "To Merkle" means to make a colossal blunder.  "Merkle's Boner" will be perhaps the most infamous play in baseball history, at least until someone else screws up as badly.  You already know about your common sobriquet.  Not a game will go by for the rest of your career without your hearing it from someone.  To avoid having your tombstone defaced with "Bonehead," as it surely would be, you will be buried in an unmarked grave.  I am not joking, Fred. You've got one more chance to avoid this. (press any key) Into the bottom of the ninth inning, with the score still knotted: Cubs 1, Giants 1.  Cy Seymour, the Giants' center fielder, leads off the inning by grounding out to second base: Evers to Chance.  Art Devlin follows with a single off Pfiester to center field.  Moose McCormick, your left fielder, hits a ground ball to Evers, who throws over to Tinker at second base to put out Devlin.  McCormick is at first, with two outs.  Batting next for New York: Fred Merkle. The Polo Grounds crowd have risen to their feet in anticipation.  You stand in the batter's box, bat in hand.

[STATE]  [ACTION] run to second [STATE]  go back to the dugout Avoiding the crush of fans, you head back to the Giants' dugout, hollering after your victorious comrades. (press any key) What happens next is a matter of some dispute. In one account, Johnny Evers turns and yells to Solly Hofman, the center fielder.  Merkle hasn't touched second base.  The force play is still in effect.  Hofman finds the ball, throws it back in toward Evers, but Joe McGinnity, who had been coaching third, intercepts it, and throws the ball away into the crowd somewhere.  In the meantime, Evers gets the attention of O'Day, and somehow finds a ball.  Almost certainly not the ball Bridwell hit.  Just a ball.  He steps on second, and O'Day raises his right fist.  Three outs, and McCormick's run doesn't count. In some retellings, McGinnity doesn't intercept anything.  And Bridwell and Snodgrass both later say that Evers never had any ball at all, and that Chance just argued the point with O'Day.  What isn't in dispute is that you never touched second base, and thus McCormick never scored. It so happens that a few weeks earlier in Pittsburgh, a similar thing happened, and Evers tried to get O'Day, who was umpiring that game as well, to rule the player out.  He didn't, but Evers was determined to press his claim if it were to ever happen again.  And this time, he succeeded. This is the most infamous play in baseball history. (press any key) There is no way to resume the game with the crowd on the field and the shadows lengthening.  The Giants press their case with the National League office, but the game is ruled a tie.  You are immediately crucified by the fans, and especially by the newspapers.  "Censurable stupidity on the part of player Merkle" is how W.H. Aulick puts it in tomorrow's New York Times, ignoring the fact that the rule you violated had never really been enforced. For the next two weeks, the Giants play poorly, but manage to hang on to a share of the lead in the pennant race.  The Merkle Game, as it is now known, is replayed at the Polo Grounds on October 8.  It's Matty for the Gothams once again.  Pfiester starts the game for the Chicagos, but gives way quickly to Mordecai Three-Finger Brown.  Matty is uneven, Cy Seymour drops an easy fly ball, and Brown is brilliant.  Chicago 4, New York 2 is the final score.  The Cubs win the National League pennant, and go on to beat Detroit in the World Series, four games to one. If it's any consolation, it's the last World Series they will ever win. (press any key) No one on the Giants blames you.  "Being held close to the bag, the crowd rushing on him before he'd made it to second, seeing the winning run already cross the plate, why I think anyone would have done the same thing that Fred Merkle did," says Al Bridwell, many years later. "It is very unfair to put all the blame on Merkle for our losing the pennant in 1908," said Fred Snodgrass.  "McGraw never did, and neither did the rest of us.  It was mostly the newspapers.  They were the ones who invented the term 'bonehead.'  How could you blame Merkle, when we lost the play-off game and besides that we lost five other games after the Merkle incident?" Mr. McGraw is always your stalwart defender, and for years, turns to you for advice in tough spots.  But as far as the rest of the world is concerned, you are Fred Merkle, bonehead. (press any key) July 30, 1950, the Polo Grounds.  It's not the same Polo Grounds.  The old wood park burned down in 1911.  The new one is on the same patch of ground.  You played here too for several years.  It's undergone some renovations since -- most notably, to enclose the whole outfield -- but it still feels like home. It's Old Timers' Day.  To your children's amazement, you accepted the Giants' invitation to come back. New Giants' Dugout You're in the dugout, mingling with some of the current ballplayers. There's Sal Maglie, the Barber -- so named because he pitches so high and tight that he shaves the hitters' stubble.  There's Alvin Dark, the terrific young shortstop.  Over in the corner is Bobby Thomson.  He'll have a big moment soon enough.  And you've just greeted the manager, Leo Durocher, famous for coining the phrase, "Nice guys finish last." He didn't say that exactly, but that's how people remember it. The public address announcer gets the attention of the crowd: "Our next returning player manned first base for the Giants from 1907 to 1915, appearing on three pennant-winning clubs.  A great fielder, a great hitter, and a leader on and off the field -- please welcome: Fred Merkle!" [ACTION] out
