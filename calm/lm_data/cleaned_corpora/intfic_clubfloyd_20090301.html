[STATE] Topmost Ledge This is a slate-littered shelf high up at the northwest eaves of a dark, vaulted cave, from which a meadow-fresh breeze blows. The ledge broadens down a slab "staircase" to the east but wastes away into a tight squeeze southwest. Natural passages extend like tendrils into the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here, back north under the lintel. Hanging down toward the dim, distant cave floor is a flourishing, inverted cedar, its roots grappling the roof, its nearest outflung branch a good 10 feet across the abyss from here. An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and creepers, spans the abyss down to the cedar branches. [ACTION] down [STATE] Top Branches You are perched inside the dense, broad first branches down from the cedar's roots, which splay across the rocky ceiling like buttresses on a perpendicular gothic column. Through the dappled green cover, you can just make out the long ledge, but it's too far up to jump across. An improvised ladder of sticks, lashed together with vines and creepers, spans the abyss up to the ledge. A tree-house has been constructed here, though it's little more than a wooden lean-to on a log platform. [ACTION] get ladder

Natural passages extend like tendrils into the rock all around this cavern, but only one is accessible from here, back north under the lintel.

A natural limestone cavity, beautiful and thankfully unused, it's a chance to rest and think. A single winding path leads vaguely north. A burnished lantern lies discarded in the sand. Dead leaves float out on the water, but of the hornet there is no trace. One broad leaf, though, has washed up beside you. [ACTION] get leaf and lantern

At the workshop's centre is the Anvil, a hard stone mounting and, perhaps, the fulcrum of the new Northlands Empire that is to come. A swivel mounting runs around the whole western hemicircle of the workshop, and can be turned anywhere on the calibrated dial from 1 to 180 degrees. It now stands at 75.78. An old man you recognise as the great Clotspinner lies on a crude wooden cot, apparently in a deep sleep or coma.
