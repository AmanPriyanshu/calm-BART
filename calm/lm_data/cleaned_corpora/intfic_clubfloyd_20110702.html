You were mistaken. One by one, your experiments showed your preliminary calculations to have been correct. When the military removed you from your project, only one aspect remained untested  -- an aspect you had been loath to test before you could predict the results -- inconsistent observation. What would happen if anomalies were observed by those in the original time-line? Your prior experiments had heavily shielded the prototype from outside interaction to avoid the very possibility. And as the calculations came out time and again, that is the only reason you are alive today. When an observer in the original time-line has an anomolous observation, the wave function of the temporally relocated object collapses and the relocation retrospectively fails, preserving chronological consistency. There is just one side effect: total transformation of the object's mass into a burst of photons -- pure energy. You tried to tell them over and again. They assumed you were merely jealous of the takeover. Now, the night before their scheduled 'first main experiment', you have come to put an end to it all.
