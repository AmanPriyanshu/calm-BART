I am the Law Written by djchallis Beta-tested by Kiravorn, Beanless & Raindrop. This game was written as an entry to an ADRIFT competition called "The Odd Competition". It's rules gave strict limitations to your programming (limited rooms, objects, tasks, events & characters). Therefore this, and the other entries, are rather short and aren't that intricate. This game may feel a little bland or empty, and it lacks much of the polish I'd like to put in. Please do not use this game to judge the standard of my text adventures or stories, but please do enjoy the game. Thanks. :-) (press any key to continue) The next two screens explain the basics of text adventures for the benefit of those who aren't familiar with them. If you already are, don't forget to read the screen marked "important", because you'll still need to know that. Text adventures put you, the reader, in control of the lead character. The game will tell you the story, where you are and what you're doing, and will then leave it up to you. Whatever you type, your character will do. Commands are typically in the form: "verb noun". For example: "Kick the bucket" "Open the door" They can get more complicated: "Put the pen on the table" "Cut the rope with the scissors" (press any key to continue) Here are some of the basic commands you'll need to use for this game, although it will likely be required to use other ones as well. I use a pen as an example in the list. "Examine pen" - give you a closer look at the pen for clues. "Move north" - walks north. The directions you'll need to walk in are N, S, W & E. "Inventory" - tells you what items you're carrying. "Look" - tells you about your surroundings. "Take pen" - picks up the pen. Most of these commands have alternatives that also work, and also short-hand versions to save time. l = look x = examine i = inventory n = north etc. Text adventures generally require clever thought to proceed. Read everything carefully and try anything you think of. (press any key to continue) IMPORTANT! In this game knowledge is everything. You are trying to solve a murder. The way to do this is to ask characters about thigs. Please use the default ADRIFT phrasing for this: "Ask Bob about Jim" (please always include the name of the character you're talking to.) You can ask characters about other characters, or about objects, or events, or places, or anything. Chances are if it's been mentioned somewhere, they'll have something to say about it. If you ask them about the right things, you'll get some useful knowledge. Always ask characters about single-word subjects, or short phrases or names. On some occasions, new pieces of information will be written in blue text. When this happens, you can ask characters about what was in blue, regardless of how many words it was. For example: "Ask Bob about blue text" This will happen for subjects you might miss or might not guess the phrasing for. But not all new subjects will be in blue. If you think a character said something important, ask them about it anyway. When you think you know who the murderer was, type: "make verdict" The game will then ask for your thoughts. If you're right, you'll win; if not, you won't. Lastly, please click on the options tab at the top of your window. Make sure "verbose" is ticked. Also, click on "Display & Media..." button and make sure the box marked: "Room names in descriptions" is ticked. Thank you. (press any key to continue) I am the Law by djchallis I stand up from my chair as I feel my one-man ship docking with the space station. Sure enough, the door to my ship opens in front of me a second later. I take out my electronic notepad, ready to make notes. There's a man waiting for me a few paces away, so I walk out to greet him. "Good morning, I'm detective Joshua Kent," I say, holding out my hand. "Good morning detective," the man replies formally, shaking my hand, "I'm Luke, the second-in-command, and now the highest ranking person on this space station." "Would that mean that your Captain was...?" I ask. "Captain Seth was murdered last night, yes," Luke says. "I made the call as soon as I discovered the body." "Very good." This man knows procedure it seems. This will make my life a little easier. "I was told this is a research space station?" "That's right." Luke nods. "We're all scientists here in this tiny machine. Our mission statement is 'to record the effects of lower life-forms under a system collapse'. We all live here and do our research as a quiet, secluded team. That's why I was surprised that one of my own would do such a thing." "Thanks for the information. Where are the suspects?" "Lined up in the entrace lobby, just through here," Luke says, and begins to walk towards a door. I stop him quickly. "Luke?" He turns around. "You realise that you are a suspect as well?" "Of course. But I believe in your profession, Joshua. I believe you'll find the real killer, and so I've put aside my own emotions briefly in order to assist you. The sooner you discover the truth, the sooner we can clean up this mess. Do you disagree?" I shake my head, and we continue through to the entrance lobby. (press any key to continue) The entrace lobby is a small, bare room that seems to branch off to the rest of the space station. True to Luke's word, there were some people lined up, waiting for us with varying levels of tidiness. Luke brings me over to them and begins to introduce them. "This is Calvin, our chief computing expert," Luke says. "Pleased to meet you, Calvin." I hold out my hand again, watching him closely. He's smartly dressed and looks at me through his glasses with keen eyes. He shakes my hand. "Pleased to meet you too," Calvin says. "I trust you'll do your profession proud and clear this up quickly?" "I'll do my best," I say, moving on to the next person. The next person is a slightly larger, slightly shorter and slightly sloppier man. He holds out his hand ready for me. "William, sir," he says. "Pleased to meet you, William." He seems a little nervous, so I don't press in. The third and final person in the line is younger than the others, but just as smart as Calvin. "Tim is fresh out of university, he's quite the scientist already," Luke says. "You're a detective, right?" Tim asks, losing the formality I'd assumed from his dress sense. "I am," I say, shaking his hand. "I've always wanted to meet a detective," he says, smiling  broadly. "I just want to let you know that if you need anything at all in your quest, I'm here to help." "Thank you, Tim," I say, turning away. Great, a wannabe. He's going to get annoying. (press any key to continue) I turn to Luke. "Is that everyone?" "Yes," he says. I'm surprised. Only four of them? Five before the Captain died I guess. Still, one of these is the killer? I guess so. I take a step back away from the line and draw myself up as I talk to them. "I assume you all know basic detective law, but for the benefit of those who don't, I'll explain it now. The simplest way of thinking about it is that I am the law. When I find the killer it is my word, although reviewed by three peers first, that will decide their fate. My word is the law, and I am free to add anything I wish to your permanent records. If my judgement of the killer is approved, so will my judgement in all other matters regarding you and your space station. I say this not to scare you but to help both you and I. You can be assured that the greatest power in this empire is working on your crisis, and if you help me then I can be assured that this will be over quickly. Thank you for your time." The line seems to dismiss itself, with each of them walking off in different directions. Tim gives me another look before he leaves. Luke walks up to me. "I'm sorry to leave you so soon, but I'd quite like to take a break after last night's events. I'll be in the lounge if you need me," he says. "Calvin will probably be working still at the workstations. William said he'd be in his room but he said he won't mind you coming in to talk to him. Tim will be hanging around, probably in one of the corridors. He's been eager to meet you. If you want to check something with the computer, feel free. We don't have a network of terminals, it's just the one machine to look after the ship. It's in it's own room at the far north of the space station." (press any key to continue) With that, he walks off. I'm left alone in the entrance lobby. I've got an interesting bunch of people to work with. One of them did it, I just need to work out who. This is how it always starts. The detective service sacrafices detailed introduction over speed. We'd rather find out what happened ourselves than have pre-prepared lengthy speeches by unreliable sources, either before or after arriving on the scene. It seems Luke knows this. Still, as I stand in this tin can in the middle of the ocean of space, it can be quite disorientating. But I'm trained to cope with things like this. Detectives are the best of the best. We are the police, the secret service and the law. I may feel tired and dropped in the deep end now, but once I get started I'll start enjoying it. I have a job to do, and I'm going to do it well. I put my notepad back in my pocket. I think I should start by asking Luke about the cause of death, and then find out some more about him. Maybe I could ask people who they suspect, and should find out what they think of each other. I seem to be short on information at the moment. Entrance Lobby I'm standing in the entrance lobby. It's metallic and fairly bare. I guess on a lonely research space station the entrance lobby is used for little more than a corridor. I can't imagine they get guests often. A few signs let me know where I can go. From the look of things, west would take me to the lounge, where Tim is, east would take me to the workstations, where Calvin is, and north would take me to the rest of the space station.

You can be assured that the greatest power in this empire is working on your crisis, and if you help me then I can be assured that this will be over quickly. Thank you for your time." The line seems to dismiss itself, with each of them walking off in different directions. Tim gives me another look before he leaves. Luke walks up to me. "I'm sorry to leave you so soon, but I'd quite like to take a break after last night's events. I'll be in the lounge if you need me," he says. "Calvin will probably be working still at the workstations. William said he'd be in his room but he said he won't mind you coming in to talk to him. Tim will be hanging around, probably in one of the corridors. He's been eager to meet you. If you want to check something with the computer, feel free. We don't have a network of terminals, it's just the one machine to look after the ship. It's in it's own room at the far north of the space station." (press any key to continue) With that, he walks off. I'm left alone in the entrance lobby. I've got an interesting bunch of people to work with. One of them did it, I just need to work out who. This is how it always starts. The detective service sacrafices detailed introduction over speed. We'd rather find out what happened ourselves than have pre-prepared lengthy speeches by unreliable sources, either before or after arriving on the scene. It seems Luke knows this. Still, as I stand in this tin can in the middle of the ocean of space, it can be quite disorientating. But I'm trained to cope with things like this. Detectives are the best of the best. We are the police, the secret service and the law. I may feel tired and dropped in the deep end now, but once I get started I'll start enjoying it. I have a job to do, and I'm going to do it well. I put my notepad back in my pocket. I think I should start by asking Luke about the cause of death, and then find out some more about him. Maybe I could ask people who they suspect, and should find out what they think of each other. I seem to be short on information at the moment. Entrance Lobby I'm standing in the entrance lobby. It's metallic and fairly bare. I guess on a lonely research space station the entrance lobby is used for little more than a corridor. I can't imagine they get guests often. A few signs let me know where I can go.

In this game knowledge is everything. You are trying to solve a murder. The way to do this is to ask characters about thigs. Please use the default ADRIFT phrasing for this: "Ask Bob about Jim" (please always include the name of the character you're talking to.) You can ask characters about other characters, or about objects, or events, or places, or anything. Chances are if it's been mentioned somewhere, they'll have something to say about it. If you ask them about the right things, you'll get some useful knowledge. Always ask characters about single-word subjects, or short phrases or names. On some occasions, new pieces of information will be written in blue text. When this happens, you can ask characters about what was in blue, regardless of how many words it was. For example: "Ask Bob about blue text" This will happen for subjects you might miss or might not guess the phrasing for. But not all new subjects will be in blue. If you think a character said something important, ask them about it anyway. When you think you know who the murderer was, type: "make verdict" The game will then ask for your thoughts. If you're right, you'll win; if not, you won't. Lastly, please click on the options tab at the top of your window. Make sure "verbose" is ticked. Also, click on "Display & Media..." button and make sure the box marked: "Room names in descriptions" is ticked. Thank you. (press any key to continue) [ACTION] push space

He's smartly dressed and looks at me through his glasses with keen eyes. He shakes my hand. "Pleased to meet you too," Calvin says.

He seems a little nervous, so I don't press in. The third and final person in the line is younger than the others, but just as smart as Calvin. "Tim is fresh out of university, he's quite the scientist already," Luke says. "You're a detective, right?" Tim asks, losing the formality I'd assumed from his dress sense.
