A few days ago, chemical weapons were used in the rebel city of Morgazi. 'Sources' blame Mugaffi's forces for the attack. According to the newspaper, this is the latest horrible incident of the full-blown civil war in Assadia. Though the protests against the corrupt Mugaffi regime began peacefully enough, the regime retaliated brutally - first with riot police, then with soldiers - and the situation rapidly escalated into war between rebels and regime forces. Last week, Mugaffi launched airstrikes against rebel-held cities. Now he uses chemical weapons against unarmed civilians, in contravention to all law, decency and sanity. But Mugaffi is afraid of the usual fate of deposed dictators, and he will do anything to cling to power. You recall that Assadia is an independent country outside of the Administration. As such, Mugaffi is free to do as he pleases, with no authority to restrain his gangster government. Strange, though, that the situation should have developed so quickly. You had thought that Mugaffi only won his presidency last year, as an anti-corruption candidate with much acclaim in the media, and was generally thought to be doing a good job in hard circumstances. But the newspaper reports imply that he's been in power for years. [ACTION] examine coffee table

Like me, you are connected to an independent system which is unaffected by the virus. But unlike me, you are able to control a maintenance robot. I need you to use that robot to save us. Take control of the robot via the portal in the Maintenance Room. In the outside world, find a Diagnostic network socket, such as WS4, or perhaps WS2, though I'm not sure that one is working. PLUG a network cable into it, and PLUG the other end into the Central Administrator socket, which is labelled WS3. You might need to find several network cables and JOIN them together: there is a cable joining tool in the old Broadcasting Studio. That connection should re-establish some internal communications and let me run some diagnostics. It may be enough to fight the virus. Yours, Central Administrator.'

A few days ago, chemical weapons were used in the rebel city of Morgazi. 'Sources' blame Mugaffi's forces for the attack. According to the newspaper, this is the latest horrible incident of the full-blown civil war in Assadia. Though the protests against the corrupt Mugaffi regime began peacefully enough, the regime retaliated brutally - first with riot police, then with soldiers - and the situation rapidly escalated into war between rebels and regime forces. Last week, Mugaffi launched airstrikes against rebel-held cities. Now he uses chemical weapons against unarmed civilians, in contravention to all law, decency and sanity. But Mugaffi is afraid of the usual fate of deposed dictators, and he will do anything to cling to power. You recall that Assadia is an independent country outside of the Administration. As such, Mugaffi is free to do as he pleases, with no authority to restrain his gangster government. Strange, though, that the situation should have developed so quickly. You had thought that Mugaffi only won his presidency last year, as an anti-corruption candidate with much acclaim in the media, and was generally thought to be doing a good job in hard circumstances.
