It is echoed by a splintering concussion right above your head, or, from the feel of it, just inside. You watch the tree topple through blobs of dull color. Afterimages hang around you in a greenish glare. You blink furiously, trying to sort out the shadows from what's really there. The runoff water is backing up behind the fallen tree. You pick yourself up shakily, although you can't quite remember falling. The air is full of smoke. [ACTION] southwest [STATE] The trail turns west as it descends.
