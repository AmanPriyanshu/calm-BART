[STATE] Darkness (in a shaft) [ACTION] up [STATE] You emerge from the darkness to an astonishing sight. Light pours onto the sarcophagus from the west, bathing the pharoah's austere face in an aura of blinding majesty. Perhaps it could be a trick of the shadows on your still-adjusting eyes, but you thought for a moment you saw those dead lips curve in the faintest shadow of a smile, bidding you a silent farewell. And this time, you do not look back as you run joyously outward and away from the grave, through the halls miraculously suffused with the light and warmth of the setting sun at the end of the corridor, as reality seems to blur and the winds of time sweep you, feather-light, forever up and closer to the sun... Reluctantly, you open your eyes to find that the sun is in fact the bare electric bulb of your living room, but something remains within you as a legacy of the trip... [You are no longer afraid of the dark.] Living Room This spacious room is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush sofa and two matching armchairs are arranged around a low wooden tea-table. Curtains hang over the long windows on the south wall, keeping the warmth from the old electric fireplace in; a clock hangs over the mantelpiece. The overall effect might even be cosy, were it not for the stark white glare of the unshielded bulb dangling from the ceiling. A simple wooden staircase on the west wall leads up to the first floor; underneath the stairs is an utility closet. The kitchen can be seen through the empty doorway to the east. You shudder at the sight of a large spider hanging in the kitchen doorway. The front door is reassuringly and securely locked. [Your score has just gone up by nine points.] [ACTION] examine spider
[STATE] You emerge from the darkness to an astonishing sight. Light pours onto the sarcophagus from the west, bathing the pharoah's austere face in an aura of blinding majesty. Perhaps it could be a trick of the shadows on your still-adjusting eyes, but you thought for a moment you saw those dead lips curve in the faintest shadow of a smile, bidding you a silent farewell. And this time, you do not look back as you run joyously outward and away from the grave, through the halls miraculously suffused with the light and warmth of the setting sun at the end of the corridor, as reality seems to blur and the winds of time sweep you, feather-light, forever up and closer to the sun... Reluctantly, you open your eyes to find that the sun is in fact the bare electric bulb of your living room, but something remains within you as a legacy of the trip... [You are no longer afraid of the dark.] Living Room This spacious room is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush sofa and two matching armchairs are arranged around a low wooden tea-table. Curtains hang over the long windows on the south wall, keeping the warmth from the old electric fireplace in; a clock hangs over the mantelpiece. The overall effect might even be cosy, were it not for the stark white glare of the unshielded bulb dangling from the ceiling.

[STATE] Great Hall (by screens) You are at the south end of a magnificent dining hall. The east and west walls stand thirty feet tall; near the top, stained-glass windows bearing coats of arms admit the light of the full moon. Below the windows hang pictures of past Masters of the college and illustrious former alumni, gazing down over the long rows of tables and benches. Shadowy rafters support the peaked roof. To the south, wooden screens half the height of the walls separate the hall from an east-west passageway. Double doors set in the screens are locked and bolted shut. [ACTION] climb screen [STATE] Your quest successful, you clamber over the screens and stealthily away, smiling as you think of the admiration you'll receive from your fellow students for this feat of daring. It is a terrible shock when the duck writhes in your hands, flattening into a mere photograph, but at least one thing from this dream has remained with you... [You are no longer afraid of heights.] Living Room This spacious room is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush sofa and two matching armchairs are arranged around a low wooden tea-table. Curtains hang over the long windows on the south wall, keeping the warmth from the old electric fireplace in; a clock hangs over the mantelpiece. The overall effect might even be cosy, were it not for the stark white glare of the unshielded bulb dangling from the ceiling. A simple wooden staircase on the west wall leads up to the first floor; underneath the stairs is an utility closet. The kitchen can be seen through the empty doorway to the east. You shudder at the sight of a large spider hanging in the kitchen doorway. The front door is reassuringly and securely locked. You can also see a can of white paint here.

As three startled policemen charge, propelled by their own momentum, into a tangled heap on the sofa, you steel yourself and take that first step outside into the dawn... The Outside World A gentle breeze of fresh air caresses your cheek as you look out over the awakening city, gently blowing the fog away from your mind, calming the fevered waters. Sorrowful memories begin to stir; the plane crash so many months ago now, the rage against arbitrary, cruel fate, the endless gloom and desperation - but this time you firmly put them behind you, and breathe instead the scent of the dew and the symphony of the morning. Your reverie is broken by an anxious policeman tapping you on the shoulder. "Are you all right? The neighbours heard a lot of screaming - we're sorry we couldn't get here earlier, it's been a terrible night..." Smiling for the first time in an age, you explain that it was only a nightmare, apologizing for their trouble. As the departing car's roar fades into the distance, more mundane thoughts enter your mind. The house will need some redecorating, the medical researchers will definitely be hearing from you once the phone is fixed, and - somewhere you can't quite remember yet - your work awaits. But most importantly, the spectre of fear and the ghosts of the past no longer haunt you, and the rising sun inspires the hope of a new beginning.
