Then, the mist starts moving slowly downward as he doubles over and screams in agony. As the mist soaks into the ground, he looks up at you and screams, "I'll get my revenge"  I'll see you in hell.  I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL! Ia! Ia! Fthagn...  Aaaaagh...!" His body collapses to the ground.  As you watch the body blackens and decays until, within only a few moments, what is left appears to be a many-months old corpse. With a loud *CRAK*, lightning strikes the steeple of the church.  With a roar, the wooden structure catches fire.  Clutching the second bottle to you, you race outside.  You watch for a moment as flames consume the church. With a crackling roar, the steeple collapses inward and a plume of flame shoots skyward. Clutching the bottle to you, you make your way down the hill. *** You have won *** In that game you scored 45 out of a possible 50, in 106 turns.
