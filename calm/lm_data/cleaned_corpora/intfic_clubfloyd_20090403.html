I wouldn't wander around too much if I were you.  Tall oak trees overhang the trail, and dappled sunlight shines through the leaves.  A radberry bush stands by the side of the road, but it's been picked clean. The six thugs that make up the Valley Patrol are here, leaning on their pikes.  They appear to be loafing on the job; some of them are lying down on the ground, trying to get comfortable.  "Hey!"  one of them shouts, pointing at you.  "It's that stoopid Acme salesman!"

Gambler's Lair You're in a small, square chamber that's obviously been carved from the rock.  The place is apparently home to somebody; a scorched circle on the rock floor was probably a makeshift fireplace, and a pile of straw against one wall might have served as a bed.  The room is otherwise featureless.  The only exit is back to the west. There's a thin little man here, leaning against the wall and chewing a piece of straw. The man's eyes narrow speculatively.  "You look like a person in need of something - perhaps this glittering bauble might come in handy, hmm?"  He holds up a silver key.  You reach for it, but he pulls it away, waggling his finger.  "Ah - not so fast.  How about a game?  I'm a gambling man, and I see you've got a coin there.  How about a little bet?  Flip your coin, and I'll call it in the air.  If I win, I take the coin.

Water drips from the walls, pooling on the remaining bits of open floor.  There are no stalactites, perhaps because there's no ceiling; instead, a huge, dark natural chimney stretches up above you, bending slightly to the north, vanishing into shadows overhead.  A narrow passage climbs to the northwest, and level tunnels run southwest and south.  The southwest passage seems somewhat warmer than the others. Natural Cave You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered in years.  Twisted rock formations in the high ceiling drip water on your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast. There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn. Top of Chimney You're in a small chamber at the top of a natural chimney.  The chimney slopes slightly toward the south, but mostly, it just goes straight down, plummeting deep through the dark stone.  You certainly can't see the bottom.  An iron hook is embedded in the wall here, but otherwise there's not much of interest.  A passage slopes down slightly to the southwest, and a more level tunnel runs east. Gambler's Lair You're in a small, square chamber that's obviously been carved from the rock.  The place is apparently home to somebody; a scorched circle on the rock floor was probably a makeshift fireplace, and a pile of straw against one wall might have served as a bed.  The room is otherwise featureless.  The only exit is back to the west. There's a thin little man here, leaning against the wall and chewing a piece of straw. The man's eyes narrow speculatively.  "You look like a person in need of something - perhaps this glittering bauble might come in handy, hmm?"  He holds up a silver key.  You reach for it, but he pulls it away, waggling his finger.  "Ah - not so fast.  How about a game?  I'm a gambling man, and I see you've got a coin there.  How about a little bet?  Flip your coin, and I'll call it in the air.  If I win, I take the coin.  If you win, you can have the key.  Deal?"  Without waiting for a response, the man pockets the key, then nods at you.  "Go on. Flip."

Suddenly the water nymph sees the creature, and her eyes widen.  "Ooh!"  she says. "Pretty goat!" You're about to tell her that it's not a goat, it's a bicorn, when the beast charges, head lowered.  Curled horns meet the seat of the nymph's dress, and with a cry, the water nymph flies through the air, landing in the center of the pool.  Her plastic sieve flies up as well, bonking the bicorn on the rear end and landing on the grass.  The bicorn snorts, startled, and trots briskly off into the woods.

And you were so looking forward to starting work as an Acme salesman!  All through your childhood, growing up in the great cities of the north, you'd admired the salesmen with their spiffy mauve suits and bright orange ties. You'd waited eagerly for the day when you'd be handed your first sample Dam Tastee Cheez Kee, and your first customer would fork over his hard-earned cash for Acme products. But you didn't think your bosses would send you down here, to this backwater near the Valley King's Underworld, right on the border with dread Unnkulia.  And you certainly didn't expect those demons to waylay you en route - and you certainly didn't foresee the horrors they'd subject you to in their caverns before releasing you.  (Shudder - you don't even like remembering.  Perhaps that's the subject of another game...)  And you really didn't expect to have to work out of the Golden Dragon Inn.  And to top it all off, a bad-tempered warrior just returned a can of Acme Snayk Rhepellant and asked for his money back. You'll get heck from your supervisor when you get back, but what could you have done?  None of these damn - oops, dam - Acme products work. You've grown quite disillusioned with the whole affair. To make matters even worse, you haven't seen the bartender for over an hour. He wandered off into the back room and never returned.

It's a dazzling fall day, but you can't enjoy it; you've got work to do.  A path runs southwest through the trees, and a wide road runs due north.  The inn's open doorway stands to the east.

The warrior gazes at you through sorrowful eyes.  "You poor fellow," he murmurs.  "I've just completed 'Unnkulia Zero,' and the things I found out about you - hoo boy!"  He smiles a sympathetic smile.  "Here.  I've completed my quest.  Maybe this stuff can help." He tosses you a pickaxe and a yellow ball, which you clumsily catch. "Take care of yourself."

This time, the pickaxe bites between two bricks, and imbeds itself deep in the crumbling mortar.  You yank it out, and bring several bricks with it.  In a few moments, you've smashed a large hole through the wall, revealing a dark space beyond.  A cold breeze blows through the hole; whatever you've broken into, it sure is big.  The innkeeper rouses himself long enough to stare at the wall.  "Urk," he mutters. "Hope you're going to buy this place.

The Golden Pool You're standing in a hot, low chamber.  The only exit is to the southeast.  Before you is a shining pool of melted gold, perhaps twenty feet in diameter.  It nearly fills the room, and bathes your face with intense heat; somewhere below the surface, hot lava or steam must keep the soft metal in liquid form.

[ACTION] west [STATE] Lost Vale The bicorn trots after you, still drooling. Streamside West You're standing on the south edge of a burbling stream in the middle of a peaceful wood.  A path follows the stream to the northwest and east, and another path cuts back through the trees to the southeast. You could probably cross the stream, but the forest is dense and impenetrable on the other side. The bicorn trots after you, still drooling. Forest Waterfall You're standing on a narrow strip of sand beside a burbling mountain pool.  Upriver, to the west, a small cascading waterfall feeds the pool, and to the east, a babbling brook stretches back into the forest. A path runs beside the stream to the southeast; there's no other passable ways to travel. There's what appears to be a little girl playing by the water.  But you know better - that's no little girl!  In this magical land, she must be a water nymph!  Though you can't see for sure, there must be gills under her dress!  And it's said the fabled bicorn is a great friend of water nymphs!  Goodness, if you could lead the magical beast to the nymph, perhaps she would reward you! The bicorn trots down the path, following you.  Suddenly the water nymph sees the creature, and her eyes widen.  "Ooh!"  she says. "Pretty goat!" You're about to tell her that it's not a goat, it's a bicorn, when the beast charges, head lowered.  Curled horns meet the seat of the nymph's dress, and with a cry, the water nymph flies through the air, landing in the center of the pool.  Her plastic sieve flies up as well, bonking the bicorn on the rear end and landing on the grass.  The bicorn snorts, startled, and trots briskly off into the woods.  You wait for a few moments, wondering if the nymph will come up again, but all that greets you are a few lonely air bubbles.  Apparently, the skittish magical beast scared the poor nymph, and she's gone for good. *** Your score has just changed.  *** [ACTION] take sieve
