But you've reached an exit point in the current VR session... A tidal-wave of mental pictures swarms about as your mind seeks desperately to cling to them, to place them, to somehow piece back together the splintered fragments of reality. Justy unstraps you from inside the Sphere, and you climb out, remove the VR suit, and quickly dress, hanging the suit back on its rack. Cynthia walks in from the output station with a thick printout. Justy chuckles darkly. "Scary stuff, huh? Freaks me out no matter how many times I see it." He claps you lightly on the shoulder, then turns to study the printout Cynthia has spread out on the lab bench. She flips through the pages briefly, running her fingers over the tiny raised bumps on one side, then shakes her head. "No change from last time. The analysis sweep still detects the possibility of an overload, but I can't pinpoint it." Justy nods grimly. "It's in there somewhere." To you, he adds, "Guess we need to do another run.

VR Lab The heart of the Project, in the form of complex electrical devices linked together by a maze of coaxial cable, packs this small underground laboratory to capacity.

Placing your possessions on the lab bench, you change out of the technician's jumpsuit and into the VR suit and helmet. You climb into the centre of the Sphere and spread your arms and legs so Justy can lock them down. This done, he steps to the workstation and does something you can't quite see. "Okay, looks like we're all set for another run. Brace yourself!" He throws the switch, and the lab spins away outside the Sphere... Coral Reef Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed, glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves. You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat, rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but your other senses appear strengthened. The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Bach's Goldberg Variations, playing through in your mind, soothes away all tension. Justy's voice rings clear through the barrier of illusion. "A quick play through is all we need, but make sure you win it. Sometimes you get interpreter crashes after a major memory reallocation. Wouldn't do to show a faulty world to the Executives."
