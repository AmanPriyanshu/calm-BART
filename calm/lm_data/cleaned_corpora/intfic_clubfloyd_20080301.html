It's nothing personal, I just..." You take in the concerned expression on his face and your voice softens slightly. "I just need a break. Not from you, necessarily, but from everything: work, responsibilities, friends. I just need a day to myself, you know?" He nods. "Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do. No worries; I get like that myself sometimes. Just in case something happens, what route do you plan to take? Your usual?" You nod. "Yeah. I'll head up the long way, on the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail, hit the Appalachian trail to get to the tower, then descend by going further down the AT towards Low Gap. I'll take the Low Gap trail back to the campground." He smiles at you. "Like I said, 'Your usual.'  Listen, I'll be back to pick you up about... Hm, what time?" "Well, if I were just hiking, I could be out by mid-afternoon, but I really want to take my time and enjoy things. I guess it gets dark about... what? Half past nine these days?" He nods. "I should be out by then. I'll meet you right back here at nine-thirty, okay?" you offer up your most reassuring smile. "Sure," he says. "I love you. Be careful, and have a great hike." With that, he kisses you lightly on the lips and gets back in the car. He waves out the driver's side window and heads off toward the north end of the parking lot, towards home.

You glance down and the first thing you see are your hiking boots. They're serious hiking boots - eight inches high, all leather exterior with Gore-Tex lining; so long as you don't walk through water more than, say, seven or seven and a half inches deep, your feet will stay dry. These boots consume most of your lower calves in a rather unladylike but not altogether unattractive way, and bits of your thick Thorlo socks are just visible. Your legs, feminine but muscular, are revealed to the world because you're wearing shorts, which, let's be honest, is probably silly, because you'll no doubt end up covered in bug bites and scratches, but it's sooo warm and you simply couldn't resist - it will give you something to complain about tomorrow, but only to the people who won't say, "Why didn't you wear pants?"

Sutton Ridge, as it's called, is dry and exposed - perhaps not the loveliest spot for a rest break.

Commonly referred to simply as the "AT," the trail covers nearly the entire length of the Appalachian Mountains, from Maine to Georgia - a distance of over two thousand miles. You wish that you'd taken a summer off during college to hike the length of it, but there's no point in regretting that now. There's always retirement to look forward to, right?

[ACTION] southwest [STATE] You recommence climbing the Appalachian Trail. Just as with the previous stretch, it's littered with roots and rocks and excessive steepness, and makes you not such a happy hiker. "Oh well," you think to yourself, "it's making me stronger. Stronger. Yes. Stronger."  You continue this rather ineffective little pep talk for about a half a mile, at which point the trail graciously levels out along the crest of a ridge. You find an easy, confident pace, and begin to notice how effortlessly your legs move on this type of terrain. The lack of obstructions in the trail allows you to take in the view as you hike, and incredible mountain vistas are present on both sides of the trail for a short while - successive waves of blue, smoky ridges trailing off into the distance. After a bit, the trail begins to descend off the ridge and into the trees... gradually at first, then steeper, and your pace finds a decrescendo as you carefully navigate the slope. Many people prefer a strenuous uphill to this, because descending can be fairly hard on your knees and ankles, but after the beating your lungs and legs took on the AT earlier, you are inclined to respectfully disagree. After a total walk of just over two miles, you encounter another trail junction. Trail Junction (Appalachian and Low Gap trails) Two trails cross here, in the center of what's called Low Gap, so named because it's the lowest pass through the mountains for over fifty miles if you were traveling along the Appalachian Trail headed north. The AT runs from northeast to southwest here, climbing toward Cosby Knob and beyond - all the way to Georgia. The Low Gap trail crosses perpendicular to the AT, descending in both directions: southeast, toward Walnut Bottoms and Big Creek, or northwest, toward the Cosby Campground and, for you, home. A sign at one side of the junction points the way and provides the mileage to nearby landmarks. Your socks have shifted uncomfortably in your boots, so you take a seat in the clearing to readjust them. Once you're finished, you decide the ground feels good enough to simply rest there for a bit.

[ACTION] northwest [STATE] With a lightness in your heart at the realization that you're on the downhill stretch, you set off toward the campground. At first, the going is rather steep, but the trail soon begins to switchback upon itself, snaking slowly downhill toward flatter ground. Though the tight switchbacks reduce the angle of descent, they also make the trail longer and limit the space for trees. There seems to be little or no shade, and the sun beats down relentlessly upon you as you descend the west-facing ridge. It's tempting to simply cut off-trail and travel crosscountry to save time, but you realize that if everyone did that the erosion along this ridge would be terrible. After about two miles, the switchbacks disappear and you find yourself comforted by the shade of the woods once again. The air is cool here, chilled further by the presence of Cosby Creek, which flows parallel to the path for a quarter mile or so. Larger than the other streams you've encountered today, Cosby Creek is full of white-foamed cascades and deep, dark pools. The water of the stream feeds life into the forest, and everything along this stretch is green and moist and mossy. From time to time the landscape seems rather surreal, as if you're strolling through a fairytale rather than a real place. After a time, the stream flows off into the forest, out of sight, and you're somewhat sad to see it go. No matter, this means you're even closer to home. The trail begins to widen, from a path to a road, and you come to another junction. Trail Junction (Low Gap & Access trails) You smile as you enter the junction and see the sign in the northeast corner of the clearing: LOW GAP TRAIL <- Cosby Campground 0.4 Low Gap 2.5 -> Less than half a mile to the campground! Of course, the parking area's another half mile beyond that, but that's of little consequence... you're very close to home now. Somewhere in the distance, a woodpecker drills in search of insects.

Cammerer & Access trails) You're standing at the junction of two trails, one running northwest-southeast, the other running northeast-southwest. At the north corner of the junction, two signs are nailed to a single post indicating where each trail leads.

Reality didn't play out like your dream.  Your teammates are still in shock over your bunt attempt, and for the most part, avoid you entirely.

Euphoria.  You don't even remember touching the second base bag and as you hit third, you look up and see your wife and kids, screaming and jumping for joy.  The crowd is so loud you can't even hear the sound of your footsteps on the dirt. The third base coach slaps you on the butt as you pass him and home plate is near.

As you step on the plate, you are immediately mobbed. You don't remember the first five minutes, just a bunch of grown men laughing, screaming, crying and hugging.  You end up on the ground in a ceremonial pig pile. You don't feel the sharp pain in your leg for at least several seconds.

You turn your head away as you watch Jason slide out the back of the ambulance; who knows if he'll survive. The vehicle continues to plunge down the precipice but remarkably stays on its wheels.

For a brief moment you hang weightless, and then with a sudden jolt the wheels make contact with the steep terrain beneath you, knocking the IV pole from your grip. Strapped in helplessly as the unguided stretcher continues to hurtle downhill through heavy brush, every rock sending it dangerously atilt, every branch threatening to take your head off, all you can do is close your eyes and pray that you're not headed directly for a tree, lake, or precipitous drop.  Finally, the inevitable impact that you wish you could have seen coming: the stretcher slams into a rock with such force that you find yourself flipping over, snapping right through the strap over your chest and arms, and landing upside-down in a low scrub tree. You're upside-down, hanging uncomfortably from the strap around your legs.  But never mind that; you're just glad that the ride is over and that you're still in one piece.

You weren't prepared for the incredible jolt you receive as you slide down the stretcher and into the thick brush.  The steep descent catches you off guard as you tumble down the precipitous slope.  You have no control over your arms and legs as they flail helplessly, trying to grab on to something that can stop your fall. Just about when you thought your ride was over, you roll past another thick brush into thin air.  You fall for few silent seconds and land on your back with a heavy thud; thank goodness the soft beach sand broke your fall.  You look at your right hand.  You can't believe you managed to hold on to your lucky Swiss army knife, especially without cutting yourself. You lay motionless for a while, admiring the full moon, ominously casting an eerie light on the ocean.  You can hear the waves crashing onto the beach and you can't help but laugh.

You momentarily black out from the pain and after a few moments, or at least, it felt like only a few moments, you regain your consciousness. You're lying on your back in the middle of a stranger's living room, feet bound and hands tied behind your back.  Two men are standing over you, inspecting their catch with their flashlights. Living Room "I'm telling you Tommy, it's him!" whispers one of the men.  "Look! He's still wearing his uniform." "Bobby," counters Tommy, sounding very skeptical, "why would Jake Garrett be breaking into this house in the middle of the night when he just hit the game-winning grand slam a few hours ago?" "I can't answer that, Tom," replies Bobby in a soft, almost giddy voice, "all I know is that I'm a huge fan and this IS Jake Garrett."

"What do we have here?" says one of them to his friend.  "Wow, it looks like some sort of accident.  Look, Tommy, part of the woods is on fire!" says Bobby rather excitedly.  "Now drive carefully, the last thing we need is to be pulled over." The conversation continues for a bit as you feel the car stop and start several times.

Let's go over your plan one more time," says Tommy, trying to give his friend the benefit of the doubt. Their voices get softer as they discuss the details of the ransom pick-up.  You don't catch all of the details, apart from a possible swap of luggage and a fake getaway car.  One thing you do hear, loud and clear, as if they wanted you to hear it.

"Yeah, shouldn't be a problem," replies Tommy, "he can yell until he loses his voice, aint nobody gonna hear him." Bobby walks toward the kitchen where he and Tommy finalize the plan. "Why don't you call Jimmy," says Tommy, "let him know that we have a house guest and to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity. Don't tell him our plan, he'll probably want a piece of the action. He keeps forgetting that he retired from the business years ago." You hear Bobby use his cellular phone and speak to their friend Jimmy. He divulges more of the plan than Tommy would have liked, and you can hear Tommy tell Bobby to end the call.

You're not very familiar with boats and most of the features of this craft are not recognizable.  There is no sail, so you quickly determine that it must be powered.  But then again, that's why you put some gas in the tank. An open hatch, which leads down into the cabin, is here.  Just beyond the hatch is the boat's control panel.  At the rear of the boat is the outside casing of the gas tank.  The opening to the tank is currently secured by a gas cap.

The boat rocks gently back and forth. [ACTION] set throttle to slow [STATE] You move the throttle to slow.  The engines rev up a bit and the boat starts to move forward.  After a few moments, the boat glides along at about ten knots.  The boat slowly pulls away from the dock.  You put your hand on the steering wheel and guide the craft away from the shore, toward the open water.  With your other hand you move the throttle to fast; you've spent enough time at Bobby's and Tommy's cabin.  Just as the boat appears to hit its stride, you hear gun shots. Your instincts take over and you dive to the floor, your possessions scattering on the deck floor.  You roll onto your stomach and cover your head with your hands, desperately trying to take cover from the gun fire.  You lift your head slightly and catch a glimpse of an older man at the edge of the dock, firing away at the boat.  You surmise that it's Jimmy, but can't be sure. The attack only lasts for a few seconds before the speeding boat is out of reach.  You slowly get to your feet and look around.  You can't believe your eyes.  One of the bullets hit the steering wheel dead center.  There's practically nothing left of it. The boat continues to speed away from the shore at about 25 knots, that's the good news.  The bad news is that without a steering wheel, who knows where you're headed. [ACTION] hint

It reciprocates by licking your face. [ACTION] examine dog [STATE] The dog is brown and white with streaks of black.  It's constantly sniffing something, probably in search of food. "Godzilla!" shouts a short elderly man.  "Why did you run away from me?" questions the man as if he's fully prepared for the dog to answer him.  The beagle sniffs a pile of seaweed and then makes a beeline toward the old man.  The man then looks up to you and smiles. "Well, hello there," says the man as he walks up to you.  "I reckon that you were caught in that horrible storm last night?" questions the man as he glances over your shoulder at the boat that's run aground. You extend your hand and introduce yourself, though you quickly realize he is not a baseball fan since he didn't recognize the name.  You learn that his name is Joe and that you washed up on his private island.  He tells you more about himself than you can possibly remember and he guides you back to his estate. You explain to him the incredible thirty-six hour stretch you've just lived and how lucky you are to be alive.  He listens attentively during your walk, but you can tell from his reaction that he can't relate; his daily life is much different here.  You do learn that apart from several boats, Joe has his own air strip with a single engine Cessna on the island.  You'll be home in several hours. The two of you seem to hit it off during your fifteen minute walk to his estate, but you're just relieved that you'll be able to see your wife and kids shortly. "Here we are," says Joe as he leads you into the living room.  "You can use the phone there," he says as he points to a small end table near the sofa.  "Once you've called your wife and let her know the plan, you can freshen up in the bathroom," mentions Joe.  "I'll let Mary know that you're here.  She'll probably bring you something to eat," chuckles Joe, aware that you're probably starving as well. Joe then leaves the room. Living Room You're in a large living room, overlooking the ocean.  It's furnished quite nicely and appears to be well taken care of.  Hanging on the walls are several paintings that look like they belong in a museum.  The granite fireplace anchors the living room with the sofa and chairs centered accordingly.  There is no TV or radio and you gather that this room is set up as an ideal conversation place. The east wall is made up of four extremely large floor to ceiling windows that give an exceptional view of the island.  Near the sofa, sitting on a small end table, is a phone. [ACTION] call wife

You tell her to give the kids a kiss for you and then hang up the phone. Godzilla runs into the room and sniffs your leg for a second.

"You bet!" you reply as you follow Joe out of the room. You're still a little apprehensive that he's the pilot, but you figure you've just about had enough of boats and it will be the quickest way home.  Yes home. That's where you need to be.  You've had enough adventure to last a lifetime. You follow Joe out of the estate, but not without first saying good-bye to Mary, and of course, Godzilla.  Joe motions for you to get into the golf cart and you're whisked away to the airfield.  A few minutes later you arrive at the Cessna. The plane looks brand new and well maintained.  He reminds you that he has it serviced every month and that he's been flying for almost forty years.  It comforts you somewhat, but not entirely. You're then led into the aircraft through a small door in the cabin and after a sharp left turn, you enter the cockpit.  You're amazed at how small it is but beggars can't be choosers, so you strap yourself in the passenger's seat.  The passenger seat harness uses a five point restraint and looks pretty solid. Joe then sits down in the pilot's chair, straps himself in and starts the engine.  You look down at his flimsy two piece seat belt and chuckle.  You're finally glad that you're the passenger.  A few moments later, the plane starts rolling down the runway. Cockpit, buckled in the passenger's seat As the plane accelerates, you glance over to Joe; he looks as calm as can be.  You look down at the instrument panel and are immediately hit with sensory overload.  There are more displays, dials, lights and indicators than you could have possibly imagined.  You can't even make out the speed or altitude displays, there are just too many of them. Joe tells you to hang on, this part can be bumpy at times. "Bumpy?" you question Joe.  "I thought you told me that this was smooth sailing from start to finish?" "Heh heh," he chuckles.  "Just sit back and relax," he replies as the plane leaves the ground, shakes violently for a moment and then eases up.  "Like I said, no sweat!" he continues, almost as if he's toying with you.  "The rest of the ride will be a breeze, Jake.  I promise." Joe picks up the receiver to the radio and mumbles something into it. After several confirmations, he places the receiver back on the radio.

Several folks help you remove the parachute and comment on the plane landing in the water just outside the farm grounds.  You hang your head in shame; you should have saved Joe.  Now he's dead. Several minutes later, you are escorted to a paramedic who checks you out.  You refuse to ride in the ambulance and ask for a police escort home instead; you've been away from your wife and kids far too long.

[STATE] Time passes... You look down and marvel at how quickly the grass is approaching you. Your entire life flashes before you at the moment of death.  At least you never felt any pain. *** You have failed to safely return to your family *** [ACTION] pull black [STATE] You pull the long black cord and the red parachute begins to open. Your body jerks back and you lose your grip on Joe.  His body slips through your hands and you helplessly watch his body fall toward Earth. Meanwhile, your descent toward Earth slows down tremendously. The ground quickly approaches and you brace for impact.  You land harder than expected and do a nifty tuck and roll.  The parachute drags your body for several feet before you come to a full stop.  You can't believe you're alive. You look around and see nothing but cows; just your luck, you happen to land right in the middle of a cow pasture.  Thankfully, you managed to avoid colliding with one of them.  As you regain your senses, you get to your feet and notice several people running toward you. Several folks help you remove the parachute and comment on the plane landing in the water just outside the farm grounds. One of them mentions that they found the body of an elderly man near a large tree.  They ask you why you think his parachute didn't open, but you don't offer a reply.  The guilt almost consumes you as you say nothing. Several minutes later, you are escorted to a paramedic who checks you out.  You refuse to ride in the ambulance and ask for a police escort home instead; you've been away from your wife and kids far too long. Interestingly enough, the police officer mentions on the ride home that one of kidnappers was mortally wounded during the money exchange and that the other man was apprehended at his beach house later that evening.  You're glad that Bobby and Tommy got their just due. The reunion with your family is a precious moment.  After swapping hugs, kisses and stories, you manage to catch a few winks.  After all, Game One of The Series is tonight.  You just hope that you don't have to hit the game winning home run again. You were: Excited by the opportunity to hit the game-winning home run; Anxious after barely fouling off a pitch; Distressed about being in the trainer's room wounded; Tranquil when you realized you had to travel via ambulance; Frightened after the ambulance was involved in an accident; Terrified when you hung upside down on the stretcher; Encouraged after you survived the forest fire; Apprehensive of the house on the beach; Incredulous when you stumbled onto a crime in progress; Pessimistic about getting out of the trunk alive; Overwhelmed by Bobby's and Tommy's plan; Concerned that you only had a few minutes to plan an escape in the bathroom; Optimistic that your Swiss army knife would save the day; Desensitized when you ran out of emotional support; Satisfied when you ate hot pizza; Felicitous after you discovered an escape option; Indignant when you caused the shelf to fall in the cellar; Rejuvenated after you stepped outside for the first time at the cabin; Delighted after you landed safely in the barn; Gratified when you found a way to get gas from the barn; Mendacious when you destroyed the light; Thrilled that you finally started the boat; Flabbergasted at your predicament in the boat; Serene after you survived the storm on the boat; Sanguine upon touching terra firma; Hopeful that Joe would be the savior; Emotional after you spoke to your wife; Satiated after you ate that delicious blueberry muffin; Panicky when you saw Joe slumped over in his chair; Indomitable -- need I say more; Shocked that you lost your grip on Joe. You finished the game, but did you really WIN? [ACTION] tie receiver cord to orange cord
