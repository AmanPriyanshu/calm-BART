And how you would continually lose yourselves trying to find some other monument, only to turn a corner and be back at the fountain again. You remember the day after Clare had gone, you returned to the fountain. Drunk, you climbed the fountain and screamed. The police pulled you down and sobered you up.

[ACTION] kill macaroni [STATE]  Maybe if you had ordered macaroni rather than gnocchi on that last night she wouldn't have left you. But you couldn't have helped that, really. I mean, you don't even like macaroni. So it's not your fault. If you don't like macaroni she couldn't have expected you to order it. So who's fault is it? Not hers--you both agreed it was no one's fault; people fall out of love. No, not anyone's fault. Something's fault. Pasta. How stupid does that sound? The macaroni's fault. Stupid but true. You rake a shelf of the bags onto the floor; long packets of spaghetti, small papery bags of macaroni, big sacks of penne. As they hit the floor you stamp. The bags split like bruised fruit and spill their contents across the floor. The shells hop and skid as you crack and squash them under your feet. The brunette turns, a worried glance back, and then scurries on. You kick a few stray bows after her, scattering nearby twirls. Inevitably the guards appear. You let them take you, explaining that you aren't mad--you can imagine a lot of men in your position would be, but you are quite sane. You've never done this kind of thing before. You really are sorry. You'll pay for the cost, and the mess. If it helps you'll apologise to the brunette. Wait... they're not listening. You end up speaking to a balding man who is really very intellectual--you know the sort--and he agrees, you are very sane. He agrees, love is a dangerous thing. It burns just as many as it warms.

Now you have experience on your side. You've always thought that there is no point putting in unnecessary effort, and right in front of you is a beautiful woman--mature, sophisticated and intelligent. Leaving the gnocchi you walk over and drop to a knee. "Will you marry me?" She looks down, laughing, "What?". You repeat yourself, "Marry me." Now she looks confused, "Get away!" Again you repeat "Marry me." She looks less amused now, "Piss off." You're not stubborn and you know when you're beat. So you stand up and walk back towards your trolley. You spend about twenty minutes finishing the shopping and wheel up to the checkout. The woman at the checkout beeps all the goods through. She looks up with a smile and asks whether you have a store card. In response you drop to a knee (your face almost disappearing behind the sill of the counter) "Will you marry me?" ---------- A story finished. But there are others... [ACTION] examine man
