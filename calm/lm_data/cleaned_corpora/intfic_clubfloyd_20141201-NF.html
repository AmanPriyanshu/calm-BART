Collapsed Corridor This was the eastern quadrant of the dome, but something has fallen away and it is now a mangle of sheets of metal, intersecting skew-like. About halfway along, the roof is so low to the floor as to admit a mere few centimeters of space between.  Wiring hangs from the neon light, but only the first segment is still lit.  The loose panel is propped against the wall, revealing a promising, deep hole into the bowels of the dome. [ACTION] examine panel

The two legs - or rather, arms - at the top each boast a shining disc, like eyes; though only one is a camera lens and the other is a stubby protrusion like a hockey puck.  The two bottom prongs are run with caterpillar tracks.  Slung between them is brown hexagonal tube. It is a Hearse-o-Matic, a Hansome.  Printed along one side is the robot's name: Charlotte.
