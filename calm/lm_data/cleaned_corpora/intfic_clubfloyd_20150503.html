[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] WARNING! This is not a nice game. This is your favorite place. A small, almost forgotten lake just outside the city limits. His parents own the cabin here, but they never go here. And you have to look for it, deep in the wood, so nobody ever comes here. But even though he's here, lying beside you in the tall grass, you can still feel work in your bone. It's only Tuesday, and your eyes are already dry, your shoulders clenched, and the spot where the headset grabs onto your head has turned into an annoying small red dot. You rub it absent-mindedly and look at him. He seems distracted today, distant somehow. "Thanks for picking me up, honey." He nods and stares up at the full moon. "Are you allright?" He raises his hip awkwardly and rummages around in his pocket. As you watch, a small shiver runs down your arms. It's been a warm June day, and you're still only wearing your t-shirt. He rolls over, his eyes warm and kind, and raises the knife. By the lake  You feel the the knife plunge deep into your chest - sudden, burning, confused pain. You scream out and he rolls over and covers your mouth, his calloused, warm hand terribly familiar. You try to writher away from under him, but all strength has left you, and you want to scream, to bite, but you can just wriggle helplessly. Tears burn in your eye and you choke on something metallic and viscous. And then you don't wriggle anymore, your legs go numb, and you feel your useless heart still pump blood through the hole in your chest. He looks at you, and above the hands that killed you his eyes are calm and friendly. "I'm sorry, dear" he whispers. "I just don't love you anymore." You look up at the moon, that old mistress, that has looked down on all our wars and all our blood, but there is no dignity in death. He crinkles his nose and you feel the warmth spread from your crotch down your leg. And then it ends. But you can't go on. Shore The Grass is long and wild, and apruptly turns into a sandy beach to the north. In the moonlight everything appears gray, ominous. There is a dark, wet spot in the grass, and from it drag marks lead west. [ACTION] examine me
