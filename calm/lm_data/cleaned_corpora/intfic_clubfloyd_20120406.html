[ACTION] open envelope [STATE]  You carefully open the envelope, and with equal caution remove the folded letter from inside. The envelope blows away in a sudden gust of wind. Your hands tremble slightly as you unfold the letter. The signature at the bottom almost makes you tear up the letter in an outburst of rage, but your curiosity gets the better of you. The words are almost perfectly written and the flowing blue ink contrasts brilliantly with the bright yellow background. You begin to read, "My dear Elaine, It is with some regret that I look out of the back window of my flat across the street. The dirty run-down buildings beyond the pavement opposite seem almost fitting. I have become lost in the labyrinth, too late I have realised I had a family out there which needed more from me than what I gave them. You were always the brightest my dear. If anyone deserves my inheritance it is you. You have what it takes: the determination, the intelligence, and most importantly the finesse. But time grows short. I am unable to explain in detail what would undoubtedly be the coup of the century. I beg you Elaine: take up the challenge and finish my dream for me. You will surely appreciate the danger, the sense of adventure. Maybe you will even find the final secret. If you decide to follow the same path as me, I wish you good luck. But I must warn you, it will not be easy. Even the first steps will require a certain degree of intelligence to overcome. I know in my heart that you will succeed. Your dear Uncle, (Signed) Henry Lambert. PS: Remember the rhyme: One, Two,......" It takes a few moments to sink in. Defiance grips you, there is no way whatsoever you will become like him. The very idea of it is laughable. You, a thief? You wouldn't even know where to start. Then something happens. Perhaps in ten years time you will look back on this as the moment it all changed. Something within you makes you want to accept this challenge, to prove yourself. The raining seems to subside slightly. It looks as if the sun is about to come out from behind the clouds. Everything seems to be happening more slowly. The calmly delivered statement from the man disturbs your train of thought. "It's time to make the choice." The man tightens his long grey coat.

[ACTION] knock on door [STATE] You reach up to the knocker and give it a big pull. It falls back into place producing a loud banging sound you are sure will wake up half of the previously happily sleeping passengers. The noise seems to have woken the Countess. She rubs her eyes and sits up on the bed. "What are you doing? You have no right to be in here. Leave immediately, I may send for you in the morning." You take your leave at this point. The door is closed and locked behind you. Hopefully by the morning, you will be very far from here. Outside Cabin You seem to have reached the termination point of the corridor. Compared with the rest of the cruise ship it seems rather bare, though you must admit the rather impressive door to the south gives sufficient compensation for the lack of scenery. Some distinctly superior items of decoration are on show to the west. [Your score has just gone up by one point.] [ACTION] wear dress
