"Y-y-yes sir," he stammers, sweat standing out on his brow, "we'll stay here, whatever you say, sir!" Peyton adjusts his hair and smiles gracefully. "Good man." He extends a hand towards the cage. "Shall we, Nicky?" Baroque Cage Gripping Peyton's hand tightly, I step gingerly into the cage. There's not much room in here, and we're forced close together. My heart races. Fear of heights, of course. The trip on the Pegasus did nothing to cure me. The lead airman - still wide-eyed and sweating - nods and throws the lever. We begin to descend. Peyton slips my arm into his. "You're not frightened, are you?" (I could say yes or no.) [ACTION] yes [STATE] "Only of heights, the dark and squidmen." Peyton grins. "You shouldn't be afraid of those things, Nicky. There's far worse out there." "I can always trust you to put me at ease, Peyton." He glances down at my hand in the crook of his arm. "You know, I put myself at ease by thinking of moments spent with you in carefree days. Punting on the Cam; summer picnics; when you taught me to waltz - and the rest." His hair was raven black back then, not so many years ago. "But the only defence we have against horror is to learn about it, don't you agree, Nicky?" [ACTION] yes

It's difficult for the ignorant to do good, and easy for them to blunder into doing harm." Peyton pats my hand. "You've always been a man after my own heart - supporting me when others told me that no good could come of my work. I don't know where I'd be without you." I shrug, turning my face to hide my blushing cheeks. We ride in silence for a while. Bright arches rise into view and the cage slows to a stop. Atrium Floor The setting sun glares through the wide, arched windows that look down on this circular floor, illuminating the complex engravings on the walls. A steep staircase spirals around the circumference, descending into shadow. The baroque cage we rode down sits here, at the end of lengthy chains that dangle from pitch darkness.

"Perhaps elsewhere. Let's go." I slip my arm in his, and we board the zeppelin. In our stateroom we strip off our blood-dyed clothes and soak away the smell of smoke and ash. I let my fingers play through his long white hair, running up his cheek to the lashes of his left eye. I don't know where we go from here. Peyton and I.
