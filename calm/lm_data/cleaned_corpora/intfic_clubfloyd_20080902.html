[STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. Would you like instructions?  [Please respond with YES or NO.] [ACTION] yes [STATE] Welcome to Phoenix's Landing! This is an interactive fiction game (or, if you prefer, a text adventure game.)  You can interact with this game through a variety of commands.  The commands you enter will cause your viewpoint character (the "you") to take certain actions, and, as various actions are taken, the story will unfold. With rare exception, you can enter commands whenever you see a >.  (The most notable exception is if you are having a conversation, in which case you will have to finish your conversation first.  You will know that you are in a conversation if the game has supplied you with a numbered list of potential conversation responses.) Here are some useful commands.... HELP will show you this message. LOOK (or L) will show what is around you. EXAMINE <object> (or X <object>) will take a closer look at a specific object. INVENTORY (or I) will show you what you are carrying. When you want to manipulate an item, try commands like GET <object>, DROP <object>, WEAR <object>, REMOVE <object>, and PUT <object> IN/ON <another object>. When you want to talk to someone, you can TALK TO <person>.  Sometimes, other people will talk to you of their own accord.  When you are conversing with someone, you will be presented with a list of numbered options.  Type in the number you want on each turn in order to continue through the conversation. When you want to move from place to place, try commands like EAST, WEST, NORTH, and SOUTH, or RETREAT (which will take you back in whichever direction you just came from).  You can also SIT, STAND, KNEEL, and LIE to assume different positions.  It is more comfortable to SIT ON CHAIR than to sit on the ground, though you can only do this if there is a chair nearby. Occasionally, it is useful to take a moment and THINK ABOUT something, such as one of the gods, one of the races, or someone that you have met. If you don't want to do anything at all, you can WAIT and see what happens next. Important commands also include QUIT, SAVE, RESTORE, and RESTART.  They do exactly what they sound like. These are the most important commands, but they are not the only commands implemented in the game.  When in doubt, experiment!  You may be surprised by what you can do. Have fun, and good luck!

[ACTION] press green [STATE] (Press Space to continue.) When this story began, it began this way.... (Press Space to continue.) In a place that was no place at all, three presences gathered.  One was dead, one would never die, and one existed somewhere in between. The Undying commanded the ghost, *Speak, as you spoke to me.* The ghost, a translucent, haggard man, showed fear in every quiver of his insubstantial being, yet he spoke before the Presences.  "My lords, when I was born, a geas and star were cast upon my path.  There was a deed that I was fated to do, yet I was torn from life before it could be completed.  This was not in the stars, and it was not in my fate, yet it came to be.  I have been wronged." *You have been wronged.*  It was the Other, and each word twisted the shape of the ghost's existence.  *Yet past is past, and done is done. You cannot return to life.  You must go on.* *Yet who could alter what I set into motion?*  The Undying's words were stern, and, like the Other's words, they beat upon the ghost and caused the ghost to vibrate like a bell.  *There are few who could change this soul's path, and only one who would.  There must be an answer for this.* *We will answer between ourselves, then,* said the Other.  *It is nothing to this ghost.  I will send him on his way.* *No,* said the Undying. There was a pause. *no?* said the Other, and, with that soft syllable, a cold wind raced over every leaf in some faraway forest. (Press Space to continue.) *No,* said the Undying.   *For he accepted his path and his fate, and, in accepting, he gave all that he was.  Mortal though he is, he lost all, and he has earned protection.  In the name of the King, I claim his redemption.* *What is dead is dead, and dead shall not breathe,* the Other said indifferently.  *He is lost, and he rots beneath the stones.* *But I will mark his path again,* said the Undying.  *And I will set another upon that path, and I will send this ghost to watch over his successor.  If his successor accepts the path as deeply and fully as he, then that one will reap where this one has sowed.  And I call upon you to witness and to obey.* There was a silence like the silence before a storm, when the very sky draws breath, but there was no sky in this place that was not a place. (Press Space to continue.) *Set your star upon his successor, but leave your geas upon this ghost,* the Other said.  *What you have done shall not be undone, but I, too, have my rights.  I, too, am among the stars, though I stretch beyond them as well.* *You are among the stars,* said the Undying.  *I accept your obedience, and I accept your claim.* The Other considered.  *Then this path is mine, as well, to shape.  A little.* *A little,* the Undying acceded. (Press Space to continue.) The Other turned its attention to the ghost.  *We will choose, you and I, until the clay of your successor's being is created.  This, I will choose first: your successor's gender.  She will be she, as you have been he, thus creating balance.  Balance,* the Other added to the Undying, not unsardonically, *is of the essence.* *So let it be,* the Undying replied blandly.  Then, to the ghost: *It is your choice, now.* And in the place that was no place, a concept came, and another, until nine concepts were arrayed before the ghost.  The ghost perceived these nine: a sword - the concept of Power a spiderweb - the concept of Agility a dandelion - the concept of Endurance a book - the concept of Brilliance a mask - the concept of Cunning a candle - the concept of Awareness a crown - the concept of Presence a rose - the concept of Guile a jewel - the concept of Serenity *Choose,* said the Undying, *and what you choose will be born in your successor.* Before The Story There was no up, no down, no north, no south, no dawn, and no dusk. This was a place that is no place at all.  The passing of time itself was all but meaningless -- yet there was meaning in the passage of time; not much, but enough that three presences gathered here meaningfully, and enough that they could converse.

Yet the face was incomplete, and the Other contemplated it. *I choose... this,* said the Other. And with the Other's words, a change came over the face, which became covered in downy fur.  The nose and mouth elongated into a snout, and small fangs appeared beneath the lips.  The face lost its indistinctness to become that of a chirop -- one of the spindly children of the mountains.

Despite this, you have always been pleased by your resemblance to one another -- you share his tan fur and crimson eyes.  Someday, he will retire.  Because you are female, you could never hold the title of tradefather in a creche-clan, but you can hope for enough training that you can spend your life traveling and bartering.

[ACTION] oops greshen [STATE] Shaghal are the furred people of the plains and valleys.  They typically have brown or black fur and brown, black, amber, green, or dark blue eyes, although the occasional specimen displays an unsettling crimson hue.  Shaghal have two arms, two legs, and walk upright, as all people do, but their faces are distinctly canine, with short muzzles, black noses, and white, sharp teeth, rather like jackals or wolves. The resemblance is enhanced by triangular ears set high atop the skull and a plumed tail.  For all of that, their hands are five-fingered and dextrous, and you know better than to underestimate their intelligence. This particular shaghal has mahogany brown fur and dark amber eyes.  He carries a short, heavy staff wrapped in leather in one hand, and he also bears a curved axe at his hip.  He displays the scarlet and silver crest of Phoenix's Landing on his shoulder.

[ACTION] examine caerwyn [STATE] "The easiest way to show you is to do it," High Caerwyn says.  From a concealed pocket in her skirt, she takes a polished wooden case no larger than her palm.  When she opens the case, she reveals a set of onyx stones, each carved with a rune, and a folded square of blue silk. She spreads the silk across the chair at her side.  "I will need a strand of your hair," High Caerwyn says.  You draw your fingers through your hair, coming away with a single strand, and pass it to her.  She loops the strand of hair end-to-end, forming a circle upon the silk. High Caerwyn closes the case and rattles it for a moment before opening it.  As she pours the stones across the silk, sudden silvery-blue light radiates up from the silk, and the strand of hair vanishes.  The nine stones roll to rest in a four-pointed star -- one at the center, two on each arm.  Only the center stone faces upright, and that one bears the same stylized star as you saw above the archway. "What does that mean?" Father asks, though the tone of voice suggests that he has his suspicions already. (Press Space to continue.) The high priestess sits very still for a moment before picking up the case and putting away her set of stones.  "This is inconclusive, but I would like to talk with your daughter alone for a moment."  Father opens his mouth to protest, but she cuts him off in a clear, sharp voice.  "We will be here, and you will be right outside the door.  I assure you, there is nothing to fear." "Unacceptable," Father says coldly.  "We will discuss what must be discussed, you and I, and you will involve my daughter further only with my consent." "She is nearly to her age of majority ," High Caerwyn states.  "She has the right to hear about such things herself.  If she is geased -- and she does seem to be -- then she must know what will come of it." "And if I refuse?" your father demands.  There is a long pause as Father and High Caerwyn stare at one another, his crimson eyes locked to her dark blue eyes. The priestess of Ferran looks away first.  "Then it could be her life," she says simply. Your father presses the advantage.  "If it is her life, then what you know must be shared with me fully before you speak to her further.  She is bright and special and tireless, and she is honored for her learning by every one of her fathers.  I will permit nothing to harm her." This last, you recognize as trade manners; it would not do for this priestess to think you are of low value to your creche-clan, lest she believe that you -- and Father -- could vanish without your family's notice.  Still, you warm beneath his praise. (Press Space to continue.) High Caerwyn nods.  "Very well."  She rises from her chair, goes to the door, and summons the graceful chirop priest.  "Escort Achatli to the Cat Chamber, please, and remain until her father comes or until I join you." The priest bows gracefully to Caerwyn, half-spreading his arms to expose his patagium as he does, and then backs out of the room.  At your father's nod, you follow the priest. The Cat Chamber turns out to be a short way down the corridor to the left.  Hachachi follows you in and closes the door. Cat Chamber This chamber is nearly identical to the previous room, including the dark walls and precisely positioned black furniture.  The primary difference is in the tapestry, which depicts a spotted cat instead of a heron, and which has been executed with accents of gold, yellow, and green upon black instead of blue and silver upon black. Hachachi is standing nearby. [ACTION] examine hachachi

"We will be here, and you will be right outside the door.  I assure you, there is nothing to fear." "Unacceptable," Father says coldly.  "We will discuss what must be discussed, you and I, and you will involve my daughter further only with my consent." "She is nearly to her age of majority ," High Caerwyn states.  "She has the right to hear about such things herself.  If she is geased -- and she does seem to be -- then she must know what will come of it." "And if I refuse?" your father demands.  There is a long pause as Father and High Caerwyn stare at one another, his crimson eyes locked to her dark blue eyes. The priestess of Ferran looks away first.  "Then it could be her life," she says simply. Your father presses the advantage.  "If it is her life, then what you know must be shared with me fully before you speak to her further.  She is bright and special and tireless, and she is honored for her learning by every one of her fathers.  I will permit nothing to harm her." This last, you recognize as trade manners; it would not do for this priestess to think you are of low value to your creche-clan, lest she believe that you -- and Father -- could vanish without your family's notice.  Still, you warm beneath his praise. (Press Space to continue.) High Caerwyn nods.  "Very well."  She rises from her chair, goes to the door, and summons the graceful chirop priest.  "Escort Achatli to the Cat Chamber, please, and remain until her father comes or until I join you." The priest bows gracefully to Caerwyn, half-spreading his arms to expose his patagium as he does, and then backs out of the room.  At your father's nod, you follow the priest. The Cat Chamber turns out to be a short way down the corridor to the left.  Hachachi follows you in and closes the door. Cat Chamber This chamber is nearly identical to the previous room, including the dark walls and precisely positioned black furniture.  The primary difference is in the tapestry, which depicts a spotted cat instead of a heron, and which has been executed with accents of gold, yellow, and green upon black instead of blue and silver upon black. Hachachi is standing nearby. [ACTION] examine hachachi [STATE] He is chirop, just like you -- one of the lithe, lightly furred people of the mountains.  Your father has told you of other chiroptera here, and it is a comfort to see one now.  Like you or your father, this chirop has a membrane called the patagium that stretches from hip to wrist, connecting his arms to his body in the fashion of a bat's wings. His face is small and fuzzy, and you know that fangs are hidden within the small snout. This particular chirop is light tan in hue, with piercing black eyes. Several braids have been woven into the crest of longer hair that runs back from his brow.  He wears a two-tone tunic in light and dark grey, and the tunic has been split neatly down the sides so that his patagium is not hampered -- a fairly traditional style of garb, which you and your family also favor, though the stylized star embroidered on his collar is not traditional.  He is young, yet carries himself with an air of authority. [ACTION] sit
