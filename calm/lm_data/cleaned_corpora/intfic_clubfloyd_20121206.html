The low, steady rumbling of a train. As your eyelids slowly peel back, you feel like you're swimming up to the surface of a deep, black ocean. For a while, the disorientation is overwhelming, and you can't think about anything. But once you start thinking, you can't stop. Carriage It's dark, and the only artificial light is flickering, but it doesn't take much light for you to know that you're in trouble. Most of your body is numb. Directly opposite you is a man, plastered with fear, gagged. His arms are tied to his sides, his legs bound together in three different places. The numbness gives way to pain, as though needles are shooting out of all your blood vessels and you start to feel more than just your pounding heart: the tight ropes digging into you, the rigid metal floor, the stale air, the gag over your mouth.
