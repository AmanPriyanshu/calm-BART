"I'm starting to think you're not a girl at all--you're more like a cold fish!" "Well, better a cold fish than an overheated wolf!" you shoot back. "Well, I'D rather be a wolf than a stuck-up cow!" The conversation goes steadily downhill from there. "Yak!" "Skunk!" "Crab!" "Hippo!" "Oooh, grow up you...you axolotl!" "Well, you're a gazelle! Only, y'know, like an insult, as in 'That Bonnie, she's dumb as a gazelle!'  I'm not calling you graceful--" "Wait, shh!  What was that?"  A sound outside the car has caught your attention. attention.It's a low gurgling noise, like the gentle babbling of a brook. But that's impossible--The Parking Spot is at the top of a cliff! There's nothing up here but pine trees and gravel roads. The headlights throw the shadows of the trunks into sharp relief. A black shape appears right in front of you! You stifle a shriek. It's only a deer. The doe ignores you, wandering off into the trees. The gurgling noise gets louder, than starts to die away. "It's probably just Old Man McDillingfitty," Jimmy says. "That old busybody is always trying to get us kids in trouble!" With a sickening thud, half of a deer carcass smashes into the front of the car, splattering the windshield with intestines and greenish-yellow ichor. The hindquarters are completely gone, ripped cleanly off, or maybe melted by the glowing goo which is now burning its way through the engine. "My car!" Jimmy cries. "That's it.  Stay here, Bonnie.  I'm going to go give that dirty old man a piece of my mind!" go give that dirty old man a piece of my mind!"He gets out of the car and walks towards the trees. "Hello?  Mr. McDillingfitty? Is that you?" The gurgling, slithering noise gets louder and louder. You can hear noises, heavy but somehow soft, like garbage bags full of gelatin dropping into a parking lot from an enormous height. A shadow rises above the trees, visible only as an absense of stars. "Golly," Jimmy says. "McDillingfitty is taller than I remembered.  He was in the war, wasn't he? Uh--maybe--maybe we should just go--" A ropy tentacle as thick around as a tree trunk shoots out of the woods and lifts Jimmy off of his feet. "Oh, heck!" he cries in alarm as he's hoisted into the air.  The headlights flicker and die. Abrupt and near-total darkness is split by screams of agony. "My brain! You're guzzling my brain! Y-you're not Old Man McDilling--" His voice cuts off, and you can hear horrible sucking sounds. Oh gosh! He's being devoured alive! Oh gosh! Oh gosh! That monster--that horrible thing out there, whatever it is--is eating him! And now it's going to eat you! Oh my gosh! Mercury Meteor You're crouched in the front seat of Jimmy's car. Well, technically now it's kind of your car, since he's dead and your were practically almost sort of his girlfriend. It comes fully loaded with all the latest options: a steering wheel, glove compartment, horn, parking brake, headlights and so on. Outside is a sea of moonless black, but you know roughly where you are--you're at The Parking Spot, with the front of the car pointing up the steep incline towards the patch of scraggly pines growing on the mountaintop. A short dirt path behind you leads back down to the main road. You can't see a horrible monster here, but that doesn't mean there isn't one. [ACTION] examine me
