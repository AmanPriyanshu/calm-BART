The grasses wave around Stump, and one or two have taken root in the Stump itself. Some day, this will be little more than a rise in the countryside. Listening closely, you can hear the sounds of running water to the north and east. A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of smoke as it rustles through the grass, which bows in its wake. Muddy Spring Here you see the beginnings of a small spring. The spring bubbles up out of the earth, and has turned the whole area here quite muddy. A gentle breeze blows from the northeast, carrying a hint of pollen as it whispers over the water. Near the Arch Well, this certainly isn't the Forest you've come to know and love. You are standing in the middle of a vast grassland, broken only by the incongruous stone arch you passed through on your way here.

Stray light and fresh air come in around a hide-covered doorway, back to the west, but they do little to mask the sense of dread and concern that hangs over everyone in this room. A hushed conversation is coming from the two women of the house, as they do what they can for your boy. Grandmother looks up as you enter, and you proudly display the Fever Leaf. Not much time is spent on congratulations, however, as you are quickly given the task to build a fire and boil some water. The next several hours are an anxious blur. The fire is built, a tea is prepared, and carefully spooned to Son. After that, there's not much more you can do, and the three of you take turns through the night staying up and changing wet rags on Son's forehead. Finally, the next morning, Son stops mumbling and coughing, and falls into a truly restful sleep. A few hours later, Grandmother announces that his fever has gone down, and you and Wife nearly cry with relief. Just then, there is movement near the Hut door, so you grab your weapon and see what it is. You throw back the hide doorway and see, to your surprise, Stranger standing there, with his son. "Selme?" he asks, hesitantly. "A selme," you reply, with relief. "Ne rema y akne." You hesitate a moment, not knowing the right words, and finally give up, and finish, "Thank you."
