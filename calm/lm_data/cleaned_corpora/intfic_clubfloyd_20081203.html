[STATE] Gateway This end of the Giving Lounge is bathed in gentle light. A set of (literally) pearly gates stands to the west. You pause to reflect on this for a moment. The fact that the pearly gates are underground adds that extra touch of Vegas oddness to the scene. You can see a set of pearly gates and a guardian angel here. Curb scampers after you. You glow with enlightenment. [ACTION] west [STATE] The angel opens the gates with a smile, and you pass beyond. Could the treasure you seek lie beyond? Vegas Heaven The underground Las Vegas version of Heaven is as big as a major city railway terminal and brilliantly lit, with a high vault ceiling painted sky blue. Vapory, cottoney off-white structures flit about the room, blown by a pleasant breeze from discreetly placed and deeply muffled fans. It's all spectacularly fake, of course, but with superb production values. You can see a set of pearly gates and a heart-shaped bed here. And, more to the point, there's someone on the bed. Curb scampers after you. [Your score has just gone up by ten points.] [ACTION] author
