Then you feel a tug, and the yarn swings in your hands. The pot feels heavier now. [ACTION] turn on wheel [STATE] Straining to pull its heavy load up from the bottom of the well, the spinning wheel creaks and groans with each rotation. You peer down into the darkness. There! What was that? Something moved! Something has hitched a ride in the pot! All of a sudden, you notice the yarn rubbing on the well's edge, fraying dangerously. You try to pull the yarn away from the sharp bricks, but it's too taut; there's no slack. After several tense minutes, the pot finally arrives at the top, and two wide green eyes peek out over the side. Just then, the frayed yarn breaks. A tiny gray and white kitten leaps for its life as the pot clatters back down the shaft. Front claws gripping the rim, back claws scrabbling furiously against the inside bricks, the kitten at last manages to pull itself up to the safety of the ledge. It sneezes twice in the bright sunshine before jumping into the grass at your feet. The spinning wheel, freed from the weight of the pot, begins to shake as it picks up speed. You reach over and flip the toggle switch off before the whole thing rattles itself to pieces. Purring, the kitten licks one paw and washes its face. A slight movement attracts your attention. It's that wolf again. The kitten arches its back and hisses at the wolf. [Your score has just gone up by five points.] [ACTION] pet kitty
