Maintained by Stephen Granade <sgranade@phy.duke.edu> It's a cold weekend in December of 1990, and it's been far too long since you have seen your friend John Baker!  But you've finally managed to take some time out of your schedule to drive to Columbus and spend some "quality time" together.  Quality time, of course, means that you and he are going to sample every bar that Ohio State University's High Street has to offer. John was to meet you at a favorite pizza and beer spot to start off the evening, but he hasn't showed up.  John's always been rather spontaneous (read that as 'erratic'), so you think he'll show up eventually.  But as the night wears on and you tire of downing beers by yourself, you decide to drive to his place and see if he's left a note or something for you there. You find his front door unlocked and John nowhere to be found.  Pretty tired from your earlier drive, and also buzzing a bit from the beer you drank, you quickly doze off in the living room. It is now morning.  A terrible snow storm is raging outside, the worst you've ever seen.  You can't believe how much snow has piled up over the night.  You still haven't heard from John, and you seem to now be trapped in his apartment.

Apparently a few days ago, a hole opened in John's basement due to some water damage.  John has been having dreams about a "Fire Witch" and an "Ice Wizard" that live down this hole.  Here's the part that's really weird:  he thinks the dreams are real.  The ice wizard has imprisoned the fire witch, and John seems almost obsessed with freeing her.  He also talks about a "magic crystal card" that the fire witch gave him in a dream.  By rubbing it and saying the "magic word" necken-sway, John thinks that he can find the fire witch.  He talks about the card as if he actually has it in his possession. Obviously, years of heavy drinking have finally destroyed his mind. [ACTION] say "necken-sway"

You land with a thud that takes your breath away for a few seconds, but you are safe and sound. West Ledge You are on a small ledge (barely big enough to hold you) looking out over a huge cavern.  The floor of the cavern (if there is one) lies so far down that you cannot see it, while the ceiling is about 40 feet above you.  The ledge leads a short distance into the cavern wall and immediately turns south. To the east, hanging by a chain from the ceiling, is a large wooden disk.  The chain is attached to the center of the disk, which looks to be about 5 feet wide.  The disk is a little farther away from here than it was from the east ledge; although you could jump to it from here, you don't know if you could stay on it when you got there or not. The disk comes to rest. [ACTION] west [STATE] You can't go that way. [ACTION] south

He talks about the card as if he actually has it in his possession. Obviously, years of heavy drinking have finally destroyed his mind.

Maintained by Stephen Granade <sgranade@phy.duke.edu> It's a cold weekend in December of 1990, and it's been far too long since you have seen your friend John Baker!  But you've finally managed to take some time out of your schedule to drive to Columbus and spend some "quality time" together.  Quality time, of course, means that you and he are going to sample every bar that Ohio State University's High Street has to offer. John was to meet you at a favorite pizza and beer spot to start off the evening, but he hasn't showed up.  John's always been rather spontaneous (read that as 'erratic'), so you think he'll show up eventually.  But as the night wears on and you tire of downing beers by yourself, you decide to drive to his place and see if he's left a note or something for you there. You find his front door unlocked and John nowhere to be found.  Pretty tired from your earlier drive, and also buzzing a bit from the beer you drank, you quickly doze off in the living room. It is now morning.  A terrible snow storm is raging outside, the worst you've ever seen.  You can't believe how much snow has piled up over the night.  You still haven't heard from John, and you seem to now be trapped in his apartment.

Maintained by Stephen Granade <sgranade@phy.duke.edu> It's a cold weekend in December of 1990, and it's been far too long since you have seen your friend John Baker!  But you've finally managed to take some time out of your schedule to drive to Columbus and spend some "quality time" together.  Quality time, of course, means that you and he are going to sample every bar that Ohio State University's High Street has to offer. John was to meet you at a favorite pizza and beer spot to start off the evening, but he hasn't showed up.  John's always been rather spontaneous (read that as 'erratic'), so you think he'll show up eventually.  But as the night wears on and you tire of downing beers by yourself, you decide to drive to his place and see if he's left a note or something for you there. You find his front door unlocked and John nowhere to be found.  Pretty tired from your earlier drive, and also buzzing a bit from the beer you drank, you quickly doze off in the living room. It is now morning.  A terrible snow storm is raging outside, the worst you've ever seen.  You can't believe how much snow has piled up over the night.  You still haven't heard from John, and you seem to now be trapped in his apartment.

[ACTION] east [STATE] Trophy Room This room looks like it belongs in a modern home instead of some underground cavern complex.  It is neatly square, about 20 feet wide by 25 feet long, and the walls are paneled with cedar wood.  It looks unusual only due to its contents, and that the west wall is a wall of roaring flames.  The room is of a comfortable temperature though. An altar is on the northern wall, a desk lies against the eastern wall, a table sits against the southern wall, and in the middle of the room sits a large crystal obelisk. Sitting on the altar is a large black book.  Sitting on the wooden table is a black rod.  Sitting on the wooden desk is a tarot card and a small bowl. A grey old man in dark blue robes is here.  The Ice Wizard stops admiring his trophies and turns to face you as you enter.  "This used to be the Fire Witch's trophy room," he mumbles.  "Now she's a part of it."
