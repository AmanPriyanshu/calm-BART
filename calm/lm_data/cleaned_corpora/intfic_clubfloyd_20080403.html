[ACTION] tips [STATE] RECLUSE Playing Tips The following tips provide general advice about playing RECLUSE.  No specific information about any game task or puzzle is provided, but they may help you think of some additional things to try if you're stuck. 1.  If an object has something written on it you may need to type "read [object]" to read it.  Typing "examine [object]" will only include the readable text if the object's primary purpose is to be read (like a sign or plaque). 2.  Likewise, if an object conceals something you will usually need to type "look in/under/behind [object]" or "search [object]" to find it. Typing "examine [object]" will show you a description of the object, not what it's hiding. 3.  Examine everything.  If components or additional items are mentioned in the description examine those too.  Even if you don't discover anything new some of the descriptions can be entertaining. 4.  Try everything.  Drink some water, kiss a creature, toss a coin into a fountain, whatever pops into your head.  Many objects provide custom responses to actions that are reasonable for the object (like drinking water) but unnecessary to the game.  You can always type UNDO if it backfires on you. 5.  Try things multiple times.  Sometimes you'll get a different result on subsequent tries.  However, once you start getting the same response over and over, try something else. 6.  A number of new verbs are available in RECLUSE.  Don't worry about trying to remember them.  Most of them are not required to complete the game, and the usage of the few that are should be obvious.  The rest are simply there as a player convenience, and to make certain in-game actions seem more natural.  They are: ALERTS, ALERTS ON/OFF (manage unwinnable game alerts, ON by default) COUNT DEFLATE, DEFLATE WITH DELIVER DIVE, DIVE IN DRINK FROM GET WITH HANG ON/FROM INFLATE, INFLATE WITH LICENSE (show the end-user license agreement) LOAD, LOAD WITH LOWER PICK, PICK WITH RAISE RAKE REPAIR, REPAIR WITH RIDE/PADDLE [direction], RIDE/PADDLE [vehicle] [direction] SCREW, SCREW INTO SHARPEN, SHARPEN WITH SHOOT, SHOOT AT/WITH SWIM, SWIM IN TIE, TIE TO TOUCH WITH UNTIE, UNTIE FROM WADE, WADE IN YELL AT 7.  There is also one standard verb that is critically important in RECLUSE.  You've heard it before.  I'm going to say it again.  SAVE OFTEN!  Yes, you can get the game in an unwinnable state.  Yes, there are puzzles that must be completed within a certain number of steps. Yes, backtracking to a previous state after using trial and error to figure out how something is done will be required.  So don't rely solely on undo.  Save, save, SAVE. 8.  If you do get stuck try the Hint system.  It contains both guided hints that start by offering gentle nudges and progress to outright spoilers, and a walkthrough which is a step-by-step solution to the entire game.  The Hint system also contains general (non-spoiler) questions, background info on some of the items in the game, and a fun things to try section.  One other feature of the hint system is that it does its best to hide hints for things you haven't seen yet.  So if a task requires steps A, B, and C, you will need to complete A to even see the hints for B, and complete A and B to see then hints for C. 9.  And finally, every effort has been made to ensure that all the puzzles in the game are "fair."  My definition of a "fair" puzzle is one that you either manage to solve in a logical manner, or one that if you do get stuck and ask for help, your reaction to the solution is, "I should have thought of that."  If your reaction is, "That makes no sense!" or, "I never would have thought of that!" then let the author know.  (See CREDITS for contact info.) [ACTION] inventory

[STATE] The oak doors tower over you, dark and foreboding.  They're closed. [ACTION] knock on door [STATE] Ignoring a growing sense of impending doom, you reach out and firmly rap your knuckles on one of the doors.  The sound is surprisingly loud.  You can hear it echoing down the long empty corridor on the other side.  You hold your breath.  Nothing happens. You put your ear to the door.  Not a sound.  Maybe there's nobody home.  No, wait. Sounds like footsteps approaching.  Yes, definitely footsteps.  Long, slow, thudding ones.  Uh oh... The doors slowly creak open to reveal a heavyset oriental in a tuxedo, probably the butler.  He bears a remarkable resemblance to Oddjob from the James Bond movie Goldfinger.  He is not smiling, which is just as well.  He probably only smiles while he's torturing salesmen.  You try not to think about it. "Uh...  Hi there.  Is Mr. Winton in by any chance?" In one powerful motion, the butler reaches out, grabs the front of your shirt, and lifts you six inches off the ground.  Holding you at arms length, he demands thickly, "You have appointment?" You can hear yourself stammering.  "Uh...  Well actually, no.  But you see I have this package..." The butler's scowl darkens.  Your eyes widen.  A moment later you're flying through the air.  You have been bodily hurled right off the steps!  You barely have time to hear him growl, "Next time, have appointment," behind you before the gravel driveway floats up to meet your pointy head and knocks you silly. After regaining consciousness the first thing you notice is a pair of shiny black boots just inches in front of your eyes.  You hear the metallic snick of a spring-loaded carpenter's tape-measure retracting into its case, followed by a rumbling chuckle. The butler, who has been squatting beside you, stands and pulls a little spiral notebook from his pocket.  He makes an entry, then to nobody in particular states, "Sixteen feet, six and one-half inches.  New record!"  The boots turn and disappear from your line of sight, and you hear him crunching his way back up the driveway. You hear the mansion door slam shut, and he is gone. Gravel Driveway The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting generally thicker to the south. You see a business card here. [ACTION] examine card

Looking out and down, all you can see are the tops of the other trees below you.  Glancing up, you see that you have climbed to within ten feet of the top. A large female robin is perched on a branch to your left.  She appears to be standing guard over the nest she has built there.  The nest contains four pale blue eggs and a bobby pin. You hear birds twittering in the branches below you. [ACTION] give grasshopper to robin [STATE] It just so happens that small green grasshoppers are this particular robin's absolute favorite afternoon snack.

She continues to watch you warily. So much for your show of good will. [ACTION] show hopper to robin

A flagstone path passes through the hedge to the east.  The way back to the mansion is west.  Otherwise the neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along the outside edge of the driveway on both sides. Garage Entrance To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for those on foot.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues along the west side of the driveway to the garage.  A bare footpath passes through the hedge to the east then bends northeast toward the cliffs overlooking the ocean.  The driveway leads back to the south. Garage The garage interior is divided into five open parking bays and a service bay equipped with a hydraulic lift and an air compressor.  A classic Jaguar E-Type convertible sits on the lift.  The lift is currently up. A battered old canoe hangs on the wall in bay four. A large red tool cabinet sits under the canoe. A bicycle is parked in bay two.  Its front wheel is secured by a bicycle lock. The two-man aluminum canoe hanging from a wall rack in bay four is old and battered.  It's had a few to many close encounters with jagged rocks, one of which no doubt ripped the gaping hole you can see in its bottom.  It's hanging bottom-outward and stored up high to keep it out of the way. The bicycle is a 50's Schwinn Black Phantom.  It has red pinstriping and lots of chrome trim.  The seat is large and comfortable, and its spoked wheels are decked out in white wall street tires.  The front fender has an integrated headlight, and the rear has an integrated tail light and reflector.  Like many 50's bikes there's a sleek horntank mounted under the frame's top tube to give it a bit of a motorcycle look.  The classic Schwinn cross-in-a-circle logo adorns the chain guard. The one piece of non-standard equipment on the bike is a small leather pouch attached to the back of its seat.  The Schwinn's front wheel is secured by a bicycle lock. (first standing in bay two) The lock has a long hasp that can be inserted through the spokes of a bicycle's wheel then locked to its frame to keep the wheel from turning.  The body of the lock has four numbered dials for entering the combination.  It's currently attached to the Schwinn's front wheel and locked. (the bicycle lock) You cannot turn that. Recalling the inscription on the lighter, you set the lock's dials to J. Daggett's anniversary date.  Success!  The lock pops open, and you remove it from the wheel. (Your score has just increased by one point.) The Schwinn isn't one of these state-of-the-art titanium, lift-with-one-finger racing bikes.  It has a steel tube frame and it's both heavy and bulky.  You decide that the easiest way to move it would be to ride it. There's only so much you can carry while riding a bicycle.  You'd better leave the paddle, the sharp hedge clippers, the leaf rake, and the peanut sack here. paddle: Dropped. sharp hedge clippers: Dropped. leaf rake: Dropped. peanut sack: Dropped.

There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds. The brass plaque in Triton's pedestal is currently standing open. The main path leads back west.  A smaller footpath continues to the east.  The path to the east passes through rolling green lawn then bends south toward the small clearing. The polished brass plaque is already open. The plaque snaps closed against the sculpture's pedestal with a solid "clunk."  A moment later you hear the faint but unmistakable sound of metal grating against stone coming from somewhere to the west of you. As soon as it stops the mechanism inside the pedestal starts to tick. A rapid ticking sound is coming from somewhere inside the sculpture's pedestal. The clock is ticking!  You take off on the Schwinn, and after a bit of furious peddling arrive at...

A rocky footpath leads north toward the cliffs overlooking the ocean. The plaque is still up, revealing the small recess in the stone behind it.  The recess contains a small silver key. You quickly peddle the Schwinn right up to the sculpture's pedestal and snatch the key out of the recess.  It looks like you made it just in the nick of time.

The elevator slows to a stop.  The doors whoosh open.  You look out onto a long, beautifully appointed hallway.  You sigh with relief. You've finally made it into the main part of the mansion.  Elated, you step out of the elevator and into the hall.  The elevator doors whoosh closed behind you. You're still trying to figure out which way to go when a heavyset figure in a black tuxedo steps out of the shadows to stand directly in front of you.  You recognize him instantly.  The butler! Your mind whirls.  Fight, or flee?  The elevator doors are closed behind you.  You're at the far end of the hall so the only way you can go is toward the butler.  You look around for a weapon.  A suit of armor holding a double-bladed axe would be about right.  Then suddenly, and without warning, the butler does something totally unexpected. He smiles, and bows. "Good, evening, and welcome to Seacliff.  Mr. Winton is expecting you. If you will be so kind as to follow me I will take you to his study." The butler's guttural grunts and snarls have completely vanished.  He speaks to you with a perfect clipped British accent.  You're stunned. A thousand questions flood your mind. Main Hall J. Daggett Winton's mansion has the kind of tasteful elegance that only the seriously wealthy can afford.  The floor is Italian marble. Groupings of antique furniture sit on Persian rugs.  Impressionist paintings hang on the walls.  The skylight is Tiffany stained glass. And that's just the hall.  You can't even imagine what the rooms must be like. You're standing at the far north end of the mansion's main hall.  The closed entrance doors can be seen at the other end of the hall.

You pass open doors leading into a regal dining room, a huge mahogany-paneled library overflowing with leather-bound volumes, a comfortably appointed study, and an atrium filled with exotic plants.  You finally turn right down a side hall and stop before a closed door. "Mr. Winton's study," the butler informs you.  He glances disapprovingly at your somewhat rumpled appearance.  "I will knock and announce your arrival when you are ready." "Hey, thanks to you I've had a pretty rough day," you grumble as you tuck in your shirt.  You do your best to imitate his first words to you.  "You have appointment?" The butler grins.  "All part of the first-class service visitors to Seacliff have come to expect." Ignoring him for the moment, you run your fingers through your tousled hair, take in a deep breath, and let it out.  You decide that short of a shower and a change of clothes, you're as ready to meet the famously reclusive J. Daggett Winton as you're going to be.  You catch the butler's eye and nod.

Once you're comfortably seated in his guest chair he gets right to the point.  "I believe you have something for me." Study You expected a dimly-lit chamber filled with dark leather furniture and smelling of single-malt scotch and cigar smoke.  You're surprised to discover that J. Daggett's study is light, airy, and quite modern. Instead of oak and mahogany the walls and bookcases are made from natural cherry.  Dozens of sticky-notes litter his expansive desk.  It is also home to two large flat-screen computer terminals and an array of state-of-the-art communications equipment.  Message lights flash. Market quotes scroll across one terminal.  The other is teleconferenced into a board meeting of some kind. The second big surprise is J. Daggett Winton himself.  He still looks like the same swarthy, ruggedly-handsome businessman/adventurer who used to be featured in the news on an almost daily basis.  A little older, a little wearier perhaps.  But the glint of brilliance in his keen gray eyes hasn't dimmed in the least.  However the information about the accident that had taken Emmeline's life hadn't included any mention of his own injuries.  There is no office chair behind his desk.

You rise slightly and place it in J. Daggett's outstretched hands. "Ah, finally," he beams.  He checks the wrapping paper to make sure it hasn't been tampered with.  Slipping a finger under a taped seam he tears it open. You guessed it might be a book, and you are correct.  But what kind of book?

But then again, maybe there's something special about this particular copy of this particular Harry Potter book.  Perhaps it is a signed first-edition of some kind with a personal note from J.K. Rowling herself inscribed inside the cover. Then you see the little blue sticker on the cover. WAL*MART $13.99 You slump into your chair like a deflated balloon!  At least J.

You do notice that it fits neatly into one of the few gaps in the overflowing shelves, and that it is sitting next to books 1 & 2 of the series. You finally manage to regain enough of your composure to realize that J. Daggett has been watching your reaction to the package's contents with great amusement.  Smiling broadly, he says, "I'm sure you have a number of questions running through your mind right now.  You have my full attention, and my gratitude for a job well done.

He gently rubs it between his palms to feel the familiar heft and smoothness of its polished surface, then holding it up to the light he reads the inscription.  He sighs happily.  "I've been looking all over for this.  It was a first anniversary gift from Emmeline.  It was under the Jaguar you say?  No wonder I couldn't find it!  Thank you for returning it."

Judging from the array of controls and readouts built into the chair's arms you would guess that it also serves as his mobile command center.  You have no doubt he designed it himself. "I'm ready to go if you are." J. Daggett responds by touching a control on the arm of his wheelchair.  A motor hums to life and his desk starts to smoothly rotate out of the way.  At the same time, a bookshelf in the north wall of the study swings back to reveal a short, well lit corridor. The humming stops. Gesturing toward the opening, he says, "We'll take the back way down." You fall in behind his wheelchair.  The short hallway leads to another elevator.  This one doesn't have any visible controls; therefore you assume it must be operated remotely from the wheelchair.  Your guess is confirmed when the doors open as J. Daggett approaches, then close behind you. The descent is brief.  The elevator quickly slows to a stop and the doors whoosh open.  Banks of overhead lights flicker to life.

"The first time I met Emmeline we were on the face of a cliff.  I was headed up.  She was on her way down.  We stopped on a ledge for a bit of a chat.  I was very impressed by her skill as a climber; and when we met again a day later at a dinner party, I was even more impressed by her grace and beauty.  We continued to see each other and were married within six months. &ldquoShe; was a bit overwhelmed by Seacliff at first, but it didn't take her long to settle in.  She charmed Harold immediately, and he really helped her feel at home.  She especially loved to explore the grounds, and she was delighted the day I showed her the entrance to the caves in the basement.  The cliffs around here are riddled with them.  Some of them go back for miles.  Exploring them together soon became one of our favorite activities. &ldquoThe; day of the accident, we were headed for a large chamber we had named The Cathedral.  Emmeline was in an excellent mood.  I could tell she had some kind of good news she wanted to share with me.  The Cathedral was one of our favorite places to sit and talk. &ldquoThe; only challenge along the route is a sheer descent of about thirty feet down a chasm wall, but we had been up and down it dozens of times before and we had no trouble with it that day.  We were almost there when Em noticed a fresh rock fall, and the new opening that it had exposed.  Of course, we had to see where it led." [ACTION] wait

[ACTION] wait [STATE] As you wait in the darkness, you slowly become aware of a faint blue glow.  It seems to be floating in the air about five feet in front of you.  J. Daggett continues his narrative. "The passage beyond opened quickly into a domed chamber.  The walls were polished smooth and had about a dozen small niches cut into them. The center of the chamber was dominated by a wide stone arch.  It was about twelve feet tall and covered with a strange flowing script in a language neither of us had seen before.  The niches were empty, save for one.  It contained a small silver-blue bracelet. &ldquoThe; bracelet was metallic and heavy like gold or platinum might be.  The outside was polished smooth, but the inside had more of the same flowing script engraved around it.  There were no other exits from the room that we could find; and looking at that arch, we couldn't help but think sci-fi..." J. Daggett smiles slightly in memory.  "Take your pick.  Stargate? The Time Tunnel?  'Beam me up, Scotty?'  I stepped through it first. Nothing.  Em got the idea to slip on the bracelet and try it.  Still nothing.  Oh well.  We took a few pictures and headed back. &ldquoI; made it through the opening without any trouble.  Em had just started through when the rocks gave way again." You continue to wait.  The blue glow looks a bit brighter now.  It appears to be coming from a supine human figure, probably lying on a platform of some kind.  The figure is feminine and completely still. You don't believe in ghosts.  But, could it possibly be... J. Daggett's voice is filled with emotion when he begins to speak again. [ACTION] examine glow

[ACTION] examine glow [STATE] "It took me almost twenty minutes of frantic digging with my hands and climbing axe to free her.  The rocks and loose soil hadn't crushed her, but they had buried her.  That much time with no air... &ldquoAfter; that, all I could do was try to carry her body back.  I remember nothing of the return trip until I reached the chasm.  I was almost at the top when my footing gave way.  We both tumbled to the floor below. &ldquoI; regained consciousness hours later.  My torch was smashed.  I couldn't move my legs.  I figured I would simply die where I lay.  And to be perfectly honest, by that time I was looking forward to doing just that.  I did notice a faint blue glow surrounding Em's body, but I was too far gone to even care what it was.  I was still holding her in my arms when Harold found us." It's still too dark to make out any detail.  You continue to wait. You can see the figure a bit more clearly, and you have no doubt now that it's Emmeline.  She's lying on some kind of table in the center of the room.  Her eyes are closed.  Her features are serenely composed.  She is still dressed in khakis and climbing boots as though she had walked out of the cave moments before and stretched out for a bit of a nap.  Her entire body is surrounded by the strange blue glow. She is startlingly beautiful.  You are so struck by the sight that it takes you a moment to realize that J. Daggett has continued his narrative. "Harold took care of everything.  Doctors, police, Em's funeral arrangements, all of it.  I was so deeply depressed that I didn't care if I lived or died.  Then about a month after the accident, Harold finally felt I was well enough for him to tell me that he had secretly arranged to have an empty casket cremated.  He too had discovered the blue glow.  And even stranger, he had found that it was impossible to penetrate.  A needle would stop microns short of actual contact. X-rays just bounced off.  It was as if she was encased in some kind of force field.  He couldn't even be sure if she was dead or alive. &ldquoAfter; that I couldn't wait to get out of the hospital.  I had to know.  I put every ounce of energy and determination I had into my rehabilitation, but it still took me almost six months to get mobile again.  The only thing that made it bearable was Harold's continued assurance that Em's condition remained completely unchanged." You continue to wait.  J. Daggett pauses just long enough to turn the lights up a bit. You can now see that the entire back wall of the room is stacked with racks of lab instruments.  All of them are powered off.  Emmeline is lying in front of them on a padded exam table.  J. Daggett touches one of the controls on his wheelchair and all the equipment comes to life at the same time.  Lights flash, traces start scanning across monitors, computer screens display boot up sequences.  He scans the instruments quickly, then turns back to you. "As soon as I got back here I set up this lab and tried everything I could think of to get some kind of reading from inside the field with no success.  I could see her, but I couldn't touch her.  It finally occurred to me to try time-lapse photography.  I set it up to capture any hint of movement inside the field, no matter how slow or faint. And I found it.  A visible pulsing of the carotid artery.  One heartbeat every twenty-seven and a half hours.  She was alive!" J. Daggett leans forward.  "I knew where the field was coming from of course.  She hadn't removed the bracelet after walking through the arch, and she was still wearing it when the passage collapsed.  But it was inside the field with her and untouchable. &ldquoI;'ve spent over two years now trying to figure out how the bracelet works.  It has to be generating some kind of stasis field. My best guess is that it's a protective device.  The falling rocks activated it.  But why hadn't it turned back off?  I've also had no luck trying to determine its origin.  The script on the arch has proved to be unique.  I needed to try a different approach." His story complete, J. Daggett sags back in his chair and fixes you with a steady gaze.  Finally he asks, "So, have you figured out what your second delivery was yet?" Emmeline's Chamber The room has been converted into a laboratory.  The entire back wall is stacked with racks of lab instruments.  Lights flash, traces scan across monitors, status messages scroll up computer screens.  Emmeline is lying in front of them on a padded examination table. An old wooden door leads west.  The chamber full of artifacts lies behind you to the north.  Both doors are closed. J. Daggett Winton is sitting on the wheelchair.  He is waiting for you to respond yes or no. "Yes, I believe I've figured it out.  Your research into the bracelet from this end has stalled.  You can't go back down into the caves and find the answer yourself.  You need me to do it for you.  I'm the second delivery." J. Daggett beams.  "Exactly!  I need someone who can solve problems, overcome obstacles, and prevail in the face of adversity.  The fact that you're standing here proves that you can do that, and more.  The only question that remains is, will you?" He stops your immediate response with a raised hand.  "Before you answer there are two additional things you should know.  The first is that the other two Harry Potter books on the shelf in my study were also delivered by highly skilled individuals.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone arrived by way of an ex-Navy SEAL.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was handed to me by a woman who reminded me very much of Emmeline herself.  Both went into the caves.  Neither has returned." You think about that for a moment before finally asking, "And the second thing I should know?" "We had both wanted children, but the doctors had told us Em couldn't. Just before we left the chamber containing the arch, Em told me her good news.  She had proved the doctors wrong.  She was going to have a baby." J. Daggett is again watching you carefully, trying to gauge your reaction to everything he's told you.  Finally he says, "So now you have to make a choice.  The entrance to the cave is through the wooden door to the west.  The way out is through the steel door behind you. If you choose it, I have misjudged you; and it is best that our relationship ends here.  You can pick up whatever trinket you feel you've earned as payment as you leave. &ldquoIf; you choose to go on I don't need to talk about fame or fortune or glory because you're not motivated by them.

The chamber full of artifacts lies behind you to the north.  Both doors are closed. J. Daggett Winton is sitting on the wheelchair.  He is waiting for you to choose your path. [ACTION] examine emmeline [STATE] Emmeline is lying on a padded examination table in the center of the room.  Her eyes are closed.  Her features are serenely composed.  She is still dressed in khakis and climbing boots, as though she had walked out of the cave moments before and stretched out for a bit of a nap.  Now that the lights are on you can no longer see the strange blue glow that you know still surrounds her body.  She is startlingly beautiful.  She is lying. [ACTION] touch emmeline
