[ACTION] north [STATE]  living room There are lots of people gathered in the living room.  Stepping inside unfortunately catches the attention of the one you like least.  Laurie clatters towards you and, before you can do anything to save yourself, captures you in a hug you feel vaguely socially obligated to endure. You hold yourself as rigid as a blade until she goes away again.  The rush of hatred you feel towards her is positively intoxicating. There are so many people here.   Have they come to ... what? Stare at the bereft?  Why?  Is this how other people grieve?  En masse? Your housemate John is sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of the coffee table, frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch, sits opposite and appears much more laid-back about the whole business.  Rick is slumped on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow; Elsie is sitting next to him, apparently watching the game.  Jess is huddled in a cloak on the other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking almost as uncomfortable as you probably do.  As for Laurie, she's leaning against the fireplace, and wearing an expression of infinite suffering like she's living her own little Victorian melodrama. And finally, in the far corner of the room by the open door to the kitchen, like a person in its own right, is the last piece of household furniture you bought in consultation with Celine: a wrought iron coat stand.  So nouveau-gothic darling. Your escape routes are east into the kitchen or south into the hall [ACTION] examine stand

A familiar giddiness washes over you after and you feel an artificial ease, as if something wound too tight inside you has finally given way.

The metal tears at the skin of your hands and you send a chorus of clattering to the silent sky.  They are securely sealed and there is no forcing them.  You can't go back, you can't go through them.  It's time to turn around. [ACTION] look
