[ACTION] open cage [STATE]  You open the cage. The small canary bird flies into the nest. After a moment you notice that it has started to hatch an egg. The egg grows abnormally big. A strong, sudden gust of wind blows the egg out of the nest and it falls onto the ground, breaking and revealing a human head. The small bird is startled and flies to the top of the tree. The head is that of an old man with orange hair and an orange beard. It quickly grows to a natural size and, jutting on the ground, starts to orate with a loud, pealing voice: "Beware. These are perilous times. The asteroid belt is colliding with the orbit of the Earth, and consequently the stars are falling. Only when the green crystal of Drunral is retrieved and returned to the pedestal on top of Mount Ganerva, can peace and order be restored. Go, fool!" the head almost screams. "There's no time to lose!" The head stops talking. A passing eagle grabs it and as it is flying away, the head shouts: "Doom! Doom!" before disappearing altogether. [ACTION] northeast

[ACTION] visit venus [STATE]  No problem. You get on the Earth-Venus space elevator and a few minutes later you are on Venus. 3 hours of planetary travel later you find yourself near... The great Mausoleum of the 140th king You are in the midst of the Venusian jungles. It was quite a bummer for NASAs budget when they found out 50s scifi was right all along. The great mauseoleum is roughly pyramid shaped and made from grey, mossy rock. And entryway leads inside to the southwest. Some alien tourists (just like yourself) mingle about. Guess these games weren't always as good about representation as they are today, where there are no complaints whatsoever. [ACTION] read postcard
