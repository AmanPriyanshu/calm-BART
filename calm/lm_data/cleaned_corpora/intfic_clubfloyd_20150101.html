It seems that the Pool has been drained some time ago. The silhouettes of Sharkmen move through the fog. Also, you once again don't feel safe. Dr. Elbe kneels behind the barricade, aiming the M60 at the advancing Sharkmen. Your most prized possession, an original Colt Army Model 1860 lies beside Dr. Elbe. A ginger cat lies on one of the reamining deck chairs, watching the proceedings with weary disinterest. Now your deck-chairs have been piled up to make a barricade. Behind it, Dr. Elbe, in a tasteful yet practical summer dress kneels, reloading your M60 machine gun. She expertly feeds the belt of 7.62 mm NATO cartridges ( or .308 Winchester) into it, and you notice that she uses your M122 tripod. As you scramble to your feet, you notice a huge wall of smoke from the huge glass doors that lead inside, to the kitchen. You quickly jump behind the barricade for cover. [ACTION] take colt

He looks thinner, bestubbled, his hair dyed some time ago but the roots are showing. He blinks and then jumps into your arms. You hold him for some precious moments, emotions swirling in you that you are too manly to express. Video games have told you well. "You have your body back! You have to tell me all about it!" "No time, there will be a flashback later." "Later?" "Earlier for me, er, the player, er, nevermind. We've gotta get out of here." "Not so fast, we need to save Dr. Elbe." "The famous temperologist? Where is he?" "Actually, she goes by Dana these days. But that's not important. She climbed out the window to attack the Sharkmen while they are having dinner in the kitchen." "Attack? With what?" "I told her of your secret weapons stash in the undergrow. Anyway, we need to help her. C'mon, >CLIMB OUT WINDOW." He slaps you on the ass and makes shooing motions with his hands. "What about you?"
