[STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. Would you like to restore a saved game? [ACTION] north [STATE] "Greetings Almighty! Allow me to tell you about your world, Aarkland." Our story begins here. The harvest time is upon the people. Their hard work goes on from early morning until all that must be done is done. The summer has been good and this winter no one will starve. That is what the villagers believe, anyway. In ignorance they have turned from you and cannot see the coming darkness. For them Ignorance is bliss, but refusing to see the truth is no protection against evil. The young girl that's come to meet you in secret is Lornedei. You watch her treading along the road and when she stops next to the water, you once more feel a glimmer of hope. She is the first child in more than a hundred years that has been born with the old power. The youngest daughter to Lorne and Noki, this innocent girl searches the sky for your presence. She smiles when she senses it and gives you a little wave. She is the last one. The last hope. Lornedei tightens the straps on her rucksack, throws a quick glance back along the road, and makes sure her sandals are fastened properly. Surely she can sense you watching her, but she says nothing. She reaches into her rucksack and brings out some bread. She nibbles on it without much enthusiasm while watching the flowing river, and she waits for you. The girl has the power to "reach" beyond what the eye can see and "heal" what is broken, but she is not strong enough to make a difference. Not without guidance. That is where you come in. As the God of this land, you must guide her. First, you should send her to the unholy stones to see what the world around her is hiding. An Interactive Fantasy. Crystal and Stone, Beetle and Bone.

Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by grass and brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east. Between the swaying grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare to invade what remains of the road. A short distance to the southeast is a pile of stones.

She waves her hand to wave it away when suddenly a small voice pipes up. "No, No, silly girl. I am no harm! I am here to help you must know!" Lornedei stops waving but she looks dubiously at the tiny creature. Once safe from the terribly waving arm, the firefly stops for a rest on Lornedei's brow. The tiny voice pipes up again. "I must come, curious am I, and I can help such as you!" Lornedei tries to look up at the fly but all that happens is that her eyes cross. "There is magic here, magic in you girl. I have not sensed magic in a long time, yes!" the fly takes off and starts buzzing around Lornedei's head again. "Strong you are not! Oh, no. That god of yours was stingy in his giving so he was. Pity, pity. You can be stronger though. Sometimes from nature, sometimes from other things. You must know girl, to regain strength that you lose, you must eat. Ah, there are some here, I have searched for these." the fly buzzes off towards the deformed bushes and lands on one of the berries growing there. "Eat these and be strong, do not forget." there is an angry buzzing, a strange grunting sound, and a thud as a white berry, seemingly with a firefly attached on the top, falls to the ground. "Me...

[STATE] There is nothing she can do from here. She may be able to reach a distant object, but she can do nothing with it. Lornedei is waiting for your command. [ACTION] reach world [STATE] The world around Lornedei fades. She finds herself high up in the air, hovering above a seemingly endless field. She flaps her white wings tentatively at first, but then she catches an upwind and rises. Not far ahead of her is a vast and lush forest, stretching north and northeast. She looks east. Between the field and the endless ocean are a few homes, perhaps a fishing village, and a patchwork of fields. As she hovers far above the field, turning to the south, she can see a road following a river to another village far to the south. It is Lornedei's own. She turns west and the forbidden forest, a landscape of gray, stretches out ahead of her. It stretches to the southwest and to the northwest as far as she can see. It is a swirling black and gray mass of mist or smoke, for the most part unbroken except for the occasional tree-top protruding here and there. She moves closer until she is above the glittering water of the Aarkland river and turns north. She follows the flowing water until it seems to disappear into a large cliff. The two forests meet at the top of the cliff, but the old forest seems to give way more and more so that the border turns northeast towards a distant mountain chain. The river does not seem to appear again. She turns west, soaring above unbroken gray, seeing only the occasional twisted treetop shooting out of the thick mist and a blue sky above. She flies on, across a landscape of gray and black. The mist Swirls here and there, darkens here and there, but never reveals what is below. Then the air seems to thin and she sinks down. She sinks down below the mist. She finds herself racing between twisted tree-trunks and grasping branches. A dry whisper follows her as she loses her orientation. Silent shapes like shadows follow her path. Spirits, hollow-eyed, pale and ragged, open their mouths in rage and longing before they shy away from her. They melt back into the shadows between the trees. Suddenly she is out of the forest. Below her is a barren landscape of sand and broken earth. The forbidden forest surrounds this field of despair, although the sky is clear. Above the mist, to the northeast, she can see a pale silhouette of the mountains. She can see a far distant shade of green to the east, beyond which is a blue horizon. The same view meets her to the southeast, but to the south, southwest and west, there is only the forbidden forest with its blanket of mist. She lowers herself until she is just above stony ground. A deep ravine separates the field from the forest to the west. The ravine runs south to north into a misty plain where it disappears out of sight. To the northwest, clinging to the edge of the ravine, there is an old ruin...a castle. Only part of the ruin is visible as the rest of it fades into gray mist. She turns westward and sinks down in the ravine. Making her way north, the tip of her left wing nearly strokes the far ravine wall. She turns upwards and flies clockwise around the entire castle ruin. Most of the old castle is gone. As she is viewing it from the outside she can see chambers, dungeons and rooms in several levels that are exposed. The rest of the ruin is at the bottom of the ravine. After flying through the mist on the far side of the ruin, she appears at a great wall that separates the castle grounds from the northern wastelands before turning southeast. In the southeast corner of the big desolate field the ground slopes down and turns into a ragged hole in the ground. Heat ripples the air around it. A large fire burns within a ring of stones. She circles the fire. She is in a hurry, searching for the thing that should be but is no longer. She returns to the ruin. There is a high wall east of the castle and she stops to rest on top of it. The world wavers its way back to reality and Lornedei looks pale and a bit unsteady on her feet. "Too high! Master? If I die and must come back, please do not make me a bird!"There is nothing she can do from here. She may be able to reach a distant object, but she can do nothing with it. [ACTION] reach fire

[STATE] The world around Lornedei fades. She finds herself high up in the air, hovering above a seemingly endless field. She flaps her white wings tentatively at first, but then she catches an upwind and rises. Not far ahead of her is a vast and lush forest, stretching north and northeast. She looks east. Between the field and the endless ocean are a few homes, perhaps a fishing village, and a patchwork of fields. As she hovers far above the field, turning to the south, she can see a road following a river to another village far to the south. It is Lornedei's own. She turns west and the forbidden forest, a landscape of gray, stretches out ahead of her. It stretches to the southwest and to the northwest as far as she can see. It is a swirling black and gray mass of mist or smoke, for the most part unbroken except for the occasional tree-top protruding here and there. She moves closer until she is above the glittering water of the Aarkland river and turns north. She follows the flowing water until it seems to disappear into a large cliff. The two forests meet at the top of the cliff, but the old forest seems to give way more and more so that the border turns northeast towards a distant mountain chain. The river does not seem to appear again. She turns west, soaring above unbroken gray, seeing only the occasional twisted treetop shooting out of the thick mist and a blue sky above. She flies on, across a landscape of gray and black. The mist Swirls here and there, darkens here and there, but never reveals what is below. Then the air seems to thin and she sinks down. She sinks down below the mist. She finds herself racing between twisted tree-trunks and grasping branches. A dry whisper follows her as she loses her orientation. Silent shapes like shadows follow her path. Spirits, hollow-eyed, pale and ragged, open their mouths in rage and longing before they shy away from her. They melt back into the shadows between the trees. Suddenly she is out of the forest. Below her is a barren landscape of sand and broken earth. The forbidden forest surrounds this field of despair, although the sky is clear. Above the mist, to the northeast, she can see a pale silhouette of the mountains. She can see a far distant shade of green to the east, beyond which is a blue horizon. The same view meets her to the southeast, but to the south, southwest and west, there is only the forbidden forest with its blanket of mist. She lowers herself until she is just above stony ground. A deep ravine separates the field from the forest to the west. The ravine runs south to north into a misty plain where it disappears out of sight. To the northwest, clinging to the edge of the ravine, there is an old ruin...a castle. Only part of the ruin is visible as the rest of it fades into gray mist. She turns westward and sinks down in the ravine. Making her way north, the tip of her left wing nearly strokes the far ravine wall. She turns upwards and flies clockwise around the entire castle ruin. Most of the old castle is gone. As she is viewing it from the outside she can see chambers, dungeons and rooms in several levels that are exposed. The rest of the ruin is at the bottom of the ravine. After flying through the mist on the far side of the ruin, she appears at a great wall that separates the castle grounds from the northern wastelands before turning southeast. In the southeast corner of the big desolate field the ground slopes down and turns into a ragged hole in the ground. Heat ripples the air around it. A large fire burns within a ring of stones. She circles the fire. She is in a hurry, searching for the thing that should be but is no longer. She returns to the ruin. There is a high wall east of the castle and she stops to rest on top of it. The world wavers its way back to reality and Lornedei looks pale and a bit unsteady on her feet. "Too high! Master? If I die and must come back, please do not make me a bird!"There is nothing she can do from here. She may be able to reach a distant object, but she can do nothing with it.

Still, the stare from those yellow eyes and a deep growl behind the exposed sharp teeth cannot be mistaken for friendliness. Another mumbled phrase is heard from the girl and the predator's eyes slowly close. The wolf is asleep. The girl kneels while the swirling blue light covers the wolf with healing power. In one quick move, she corrects the broken leg to allow it to heal properly. A long while passes. Then she sits back in the grass, tired but smiling. She lets the healing light dissipate in the air. "All is well Master. I shall call her Deini." Another long while passes. The air is warm but a slight breeze moves the grass around Lornedei. It sways gently, like waves, across the vast field. The wolf opens its eyes, blinks, gets up. Lornedei sits on the ground with a confident smile on her lips and her hands in her lap. The beautiful animal stands absolutely still for a moment, meeting the girl's eyes. Then, in a heartbeat, it turns away. It runs along the edge of the forest. It stops near a big tree and turns around to watch the human. It sits down while considering its options. Then suddenly, the wolf that Lornedei named "Deini" comes running back. She smells the human, inspects her carefully, and makes a decision. She puts a cool muzzle in the hand that Lornedei is holding out. Lornedei has gained a friend.

The forbidden forest is to the west and the old forest to the east. The river flows back south and down takes her to the bottom of the river. To the north the river disappears out of sight around a bend, and there is a slight opening in the trees to the east. A tiny voice suddenly pipes up from somewhere in the dark forest.

It is more like an infestation of these things, these leaves. They are leaves are they not? They grow in clusters that hang down from each limb. They give the entire forest a drooping, weighed down appearance. Each cluster holds somewhere around eight shell-like leaves and each branch holds eight to twelve clusters, depending on the size of the tree. The occasional single leaf grows directly on the black trunk of some of the trees. They look more like a shimmering wart or pimple growing on the scorched bark. The clusters look more and more like colonies of big water bugs clinging to each other in fear of dropping to the ground. The leaves move, but not by wind. There is a barely perceptible rearrangement within the clusters. A quick adjustment of the leaves takes place and then it is entirely still again. Each slight movement in a cluster creates a dry, scratching, whispering sound. The sound generated by a single cluster of leaves is barely audible, but since some of the clusters are always moving, the resulting sound is a shrill whispering, a scraping, almost a singing. It is a strangely modulated melody that travels from tree to tree through the forest. It varies in pitch and volume but is always present. [ACTION] reach leaf

An oppressive gray fog hangs over everything and seems to add weight to the air itself. There is a presence here. Something is waiting among the dark trees. Something sinister. The gray mist hides the sun from sight and there is no way to make out which direction is which. The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across. It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides. A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing. Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way up. A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow in a loose circle around the oak and the altar. An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house. On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden forest. The roots under the big oak stir restlessly.

The forgotten ones, when they were still only humans, were chained in there. Sometimes they were chained for hours, sometimes for weeks. They all gave up their names in the end, and their spirits fled into the vast forest. The trees were still green, the soil not yet tainted beyond repair, the forest alive and well. What stands here now is a crumbling round stone building not more than perhaps six paces from opening to far wall, with a mostly sunken in roof. The opening in the gray and faltering stonework, the only opening, leads into darkness. This ragged and sorrowful eye is slightly askew and it seems to glare moodily at the altar, dead tired of the view, or perhaps relishing it. The door that must have hung there at one point is now gone. It is most likely now rotting away under a layer of dirt. Since the rituals ended, there has been no one to tend to this house of shame. The acknowledgement of its existence perhaps too painful. The acts of cruelty, so wrongly justified in the name of peace, have stopped. The screams are now silence, but the memories remain.

What stands here now is a crumbling round stone building not more than perhaps six paces from opening to far wall, with a mostly sunken in roof. The opening in the gray and faltering stonework, the only opening, leads into darkness. This ragged and sorrowful eye is slightly askew and it seems to glare moodily at the altar, dead tired of the view, or perhaps relishing it. The door that must have hung there at one point is now gone. It is most likely now rotting away under a layer of dirt. Since the rituals ended, there has been no one to tend to this house of shame. The acknowledgement of its existence perhaps too painful. The acts of cruelty, so wrongly justified in the name of peace, have stopped. The screams are now silence, but the memories remain.

[ACTION] up [STATE] Hall of Severance (In the Black Oak) A shiver runs through the tree and the shrill song of the leaves seems to increase in volume for a moment. Lornedei folds herself over the branch and stays hanging precariously over it. She looks down. The clearing below her swims out of focus, seems to move away from her and then come rushing back at her. She clings desperately to the scorched limb, unsure if she is going to slide backwards and down on the ground, or tip over forward with the same fatal result. She shuts her eyes hard. And the world is still once more. Very carefully, she lifts one leg over the branch and then she is sitting steady. She opens her eyes and with a sigh of relief. The clearing looks as it should, all considering. Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can climb down to the ground or follow the branch. [ACTION] examine smoke

Hall of Severance The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across. It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides. A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing. Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way up. A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow in a loose circle around the oak and the altar. An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house. On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden forest. The roots under the big oak stir restlessly. The shadows beneath them seem to grow momentarily, but when Lornedei Looks at them the movement stops. She can also see a large black beetle (Taking a nap at the moment.) here. [ACTION] examine altar

[ACTION] enter house [STATE] Hall of Severance (In the House of Penance) Lornedei steps through the crumbling opening into a darkness that is not quite total. There is dim light sifting down from the ruined ceiling above. She glances up, perhaps fearing that the whole construction will give up at her intrusion. But the only thing falling down on her is the weight of history; stories of cruel ignorance, memories that linger. The light catches a glittering thread and Lornedei swipes at the descending spider before it can land on her. With a grimace she steps on it before it can scramble away, burying it in the dry dirt. She looks around, but if there are more spiders here, they keep out of her way. The many years have taken its toll on this house. The circular wall tapers slightly towards the ceiling. Above her, a framework of thick beams support several generations worth of spider webs. There is not much left of the roof now. The light from outside leaks in through the holes in the ceiling. It magnifies the presence of fine dry dust that floats lazily in the still air. Long since rotted straw and reeds cover the earthen floor. A pair of rusty manacles hangs on the wall.

Something causes her to look back, though, perhaps a sense of shame for disturbing this final resting place. She stares at the human skull peeking out from its shallow grave, and goes to cover it again. Before she can throw a handful of the old straw over it, she stops. There is a sudden glimmering light from within one of the dark holes. There is something inside the skull. She also notices a small pouch in the shallow grave, half buried in the dirt.

Her feet feel strangely heavy and clumsy, as if the undergrowth hinders her movement. However there is nothing growing on the path. It is empty. Flat and hard-packed, it should be easy to walk on.

[ACTION] follow beetle [STATE] The black beetle is still for a few moments. Sniffing the air for danger. Then suddenly it decides where to go and takes off along one of the paths. Lornedei follows. Shadows reach for her, imaginary or not, from the growing darkness between the trees, as she moves into the forbidden forest. The beetle is ahead of her, leading on, stopping now and then to find its way. The path twists and changes direction so many times that Lornedei has to rely totally on her glimmering little guide. Lornedei keeps her eye on the bug, but looks around now and then. The trees all look the same. No matter which kind they might have been originally, they are now all black and scorched. Clusters of leaves, singing their strange melody, hang from nearly all of them, some nearly touching the undergrowth. The forest is cold, the air thick, and Cowering under the stare of the shadows, she moves on. The bug leads. It runs ahead, over a dry and cracked puddle of mud, through the hollowed out insides of a dead tree, forward. The beetle stops. Its antennae wave frantically and it spins around on the ground a couple of times. When Lornedei reaches down to pick it up it quickly unfolds its wings, takes off with a buzzing and disappears among the trees. Forbidden Forest (Near the Raven Tree) Disappointed, Lornedei looks around. "I think I am lost." The scorched trees tower over anyone and anything unfortunate enough to be here. An air of ill will hangs over the treetops. The gray fog touches the trees highest branches, hiding the sun from view. Two paths lead into the black forest from here. Lornedei sighs. An enormous raven sits high up on a blackened branch, surrounded by the bug like leaves. It stares unblinking at Lornedei as she moves around in the crossing. It greets her with a threatening flutter with the wings, a guttural croaking and constant nervous sidestepping on the branch. [Your holiness has just gone up by five.] [ACTION] reach raven
[STATE] The black beetle is still for a few moments. Sniffing the air for danger. Then suddenly it decides where to go and takes off along one of the paths. Lornedei follows. Shadows reach for her, imaginary or not, from the growing darkness between the trees, as she moves into the forbidden forest. The beetle is ahead of her, leading on, stopping now and then to find its way. The path twists and changes direction so many times that Lornedei has to rely totally on her glimmering little guide.

Most interested, it moves restlessly on its branch. Lornedei slowly puts the beetle on the ground. She steps back and waits. The beetle turns towards Lornedei, turns back, notices the bird and makes a run for it. It heads for the high grass. The hungry bird dives from the tree and drops in a cloud of dirt between the bug and the safe undergrowth. The beetle stops dead in its track, changes direction and rushes forward, but the bird is already there, flipping the bug over. For one moment, it is immobilized. That moment is enough. While the beetle is helpless, the bird gets to the eating. Big chunks of the insect's body is ripped out and swallowed. At some point, the legs and antennae stop moving. Finally, there is nothing left of the beetle but an empty shell, lined with a few sad remains of legs, flesh, and unidentifiable insect parts. The bird skips along the path where, if one looks hard enough, one can see another trail. The bird turns to Lornedei and croaks. Waiting. [Your holiness has just gone up by five.] [ACTION] take leaf

It flies in circles in front of her, high up and almost out of sight at times but always close enough for Lornedei to follow. The path winds its way through and around the disturbing shadows of the forbidden forest. Fallen trees and dense undergrowth is constantly in her way and she has to climb over, through, or around these obstacles, while keeping an eye on the bird. It is just ahead and above her. She follows the black bird, expecting the cold grip of the forgotten ones around her ankles at any moment. Images of soul wrenching, flesh ripping, and blood drinking spirits run through her mind. Nothing happens. Exhausted and bruised, with her clothes torn and dusty, she stumbles on. Something grabs her foot; she loses her balance and falls forward with a painful thud. Frozen in a breathless heap on the ground, she takes a moment to gather her strength as well as her breath. The bird croaks, Light seeps in through her closed eyelids. She looks up in time to catch a final glimpse of the bird. It disappears into a glowing sunset beyond a desolate field. Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair) Slowly Lornedei gets up on her feet. Nearly blinded by the light from the dying sun, she inspects the damage. She sighs deeply. She opens her mouth to speak again but the words never come. She takes in the view of this seemingly empty wasteland in shocked silence for some time. She swallows. A dry wind tugs at her clothing while playing restlessly in the dry ground. Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the uniform gray ahead. The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun.

[STATE] She can't find anything like that. Are you sure it's here? [ACTION] reach amulet [STATE] A golden haired woman walks across the courtyard of a long lost castle. A young lad in a brown tunic with a wooden sword in hand immediately interrupts his training to bow respectfully as she passes. An exhausted but smiling young woman lies in a bed with an infant in her arms. The blue light reflected in the child's so far unseeing eyes comes from a crystal hanging around the new mother's neck. A white haired old woman reaches into her robe to hold up a shining blue crystal hanging on a silver chain. She pulls it over her head and hands it to the girl kneeling before her on the stone floor. Generation after generation passes by in Lornedei's mind. Fleeing images of the many bearers, the many powerful women yielding respect and sometimes fear, but never hatred. Not until the final image. The amulet is thrown carelessly on top of a broken and bloody mess lying against cold stone. This very wall. Lornedei shivers and lets go of the crystal. [ACTION] get crystal

A mumble, a nervous questioning, a whispered reply. A moment of silence. A silver cup carried the last two steps to the roots below the tree. A trickle of water, a new light bearer's gift, then the acceptance of it, knowing the young one is true and strong. A golden acorn drops to the ground. Ages has passed, eons of repeated procedures, of dying and re-birth. The golden oak feels no fear, no regret, knowing that after this life, it will come again.

A moving darkness that emerges from the air itself creeps across the stone to melt into a crack in a stone or a mortar joint. It glides over the ground until sinking between the flagstones. Then the world breaks. Although the images are old, the time long ago, the earth seems to shake under her feet. A woman runs past her, fleeing through deadly projectiles dislodged from falling towers, towards the main gate. Holding her arms above her head, she stumbles and falls. The moment after, the ground disappears ahead of her. The ground moves, cracks, and slides away as she is scrambling back. The woman gets up on her feet, staggers before regaining some balance, and backs away from the opening in the earth that was not there a moment ago. The castle cracks as the ground, solid stone, disappears beneath it. The south wall crumbles into piles of stone. Everything starting at an imagined line drawn between the two great gates and beyond them, drops away through a cloud of smoke and dust.

There is nothing strange about the stones at a distance. It could just be a collection of fieldstones, perhaps from the time when the settlers first prepared the field. Nothing could be more wrong. There are piles of stones in many fields, but none with this kind of history. She hesitates and turns to you. It seems like she wants to say something. She keeps silent and steps up on the platform. The collection of stones is over ten paces from edge to edge. The top has been flattened to create a platform and that is where Lornedei stands. No new stones have been added in several hundred years. Despite the lack of activity, nothing grows near the stones. There are powers here that make it easier for her to use her magic. You can make her see what hides around her. She will see the world as it is, what hides beyond what the eye can see. She can go north to the field or northwest back to the dusty road.

I am no harm! I am here to help you must know!" Lornedei stops waving but she looks dubiously at the tiny creature. Once safe from the terribly waving arm, the firefly stops for a rest on Lornedei's brow. The tiny voice pipes up again. "I must come, curious am I, and I can help such as you!" Lornedei tries to look up at the fly but all that happens is that her eyes cross. "There is magic here, magic in you girl. I have not sensed magic in a long time, yes!" the fly takes off and starts buzzing around Lornedei's head again. "Strong you are not! Oh, no. That god of yours was stingy in his giving so he was. Pity, pity. You can be stronger though. Sometimes from nature, sometimes from other things. You must know girl, to regain strength that you lose, you must eat. Ah, there are some here, I have searched for these." the fly buzzes off towards the deformed bushes and lands on one of the berries growing there. "Eat these and be strong, do not forget." there is an angry buzzing, a strange grunting sound, and a thud as a white berry, seemingly with a firefly attached on the top, falls to the ground. "Me... Will just.." In an amazing display of over-insectile powers, the fly lifts the berry off the ground. "will just take this." The firefly, along with its booty, disappears with a pop and a flash.

Still, the stare from those yellow eyes and a deep growl behind the exposed sharp teeth cannot be mistaken for friendliness. Another mumbled phrase is heard from the girl and the predator's eyes slowly close. The wolf is asleep. The girl kneels while the swirling blue light covers the wolf with healing power. In one quick move, she corrects the broken leg to allow it to heal properly. A long while passes. Then she sits back in the grass, tired but smiling. She lets the healing light dissipate in the air. "All is well Master. I shall call her Deini." Another long while passes. The air is warm but a slight breeze moves the grass around Lornedei. It sways gently, like waves, across the vast field. The wolf opens its eyes, blinks, gets up. Lornedei sits on the ground with a confident smile on her lips and her hands in her lap. The beautiful animal stands absolutely still for a moment, meeting the girl's eyes. Then, in a heartbeat, it turns away. It runs along the edge of the forest. It stops near a big tree and turns around to watch the human. It sits down while considering its options. Then suddenly, the wolf that Lornedei named "Deini" comes running back. She smells the human, inspects her carefully, and makes a decision. She puts a cool muzzle in the hand that Lornedei is holding out. Lornedei has gained a friend.

[STATE] Aarkland (On the Unholy Stones) [ACTION] reach world [STATE] The world around Lornedei fades. She finds herself high up in the air, hovering above a seemingly endless field. She flaps her white wings tentatively at first, but then she catches an upwind and rises. Not far ahead of her is a vast and lush forest, stretching north and northeast. She looks east. Between the field and the endless ocean are a few homes, perhaps a fishing village, and a patchwork of fields. As she hovers far above the field, turning to the south, she can see a road following a river to another village far to the south. It is Lornedei's own. She turns west and the forbidden forest, a landscape of gray, stretches out ahead of her. It stretches to the southwest and to the northwest as far as she can see. It is a swirling black and gray mass of mist or smoke, for the most part unbroken except for the occasional tree-top protruding here and there. She moves closer until she is above the glittering water of the Aarkland river and turns north. She follows the flowing water until it seems to disappear into a large cliff. The two forests meet at the top of the cliff, but the old forest seems to give way more and more so that the border turns northeast towards a distant mountain chain. The river does not seem to appear again. She turns west, soaring above unbroken gray, seeing only the occasional twisted treetop shooting out of the thick mist and a blue sky above. She flies on, across a landscape of gray and black. The mist Swirls here and there, darkens here and there, but never reveals what is below. Then the air seems to thin and she sinks down. She sinks down below the mist. She finds herself racing between twisted tree-trunks and grasping branches. A dry whisper follows her as she loses her orientation. Silent shapes like shadows follow her path. Spirits, hollow-eyed, pale and ragged, open their mouths in rage and longing before they shy away from her. They melt back into the shadows between the trees. Suddenly she is out of the forest. Below her is a barren landscape of sand and broken earth. The forbidden forest surrounds this field of despair, although the sky is clear. Above the mist, to the northeast, she can see a pale silhouette of the mountains. She can see a far distant shade of green to the east, beyond which is a blue horizon. The same view meets her to the southeast, but to the south, southwest and west, there is only the forbidden forest with its blanket of mist. She lowers herself until she is just above stony ground. A deep ravine separates the field from the forest to the west. The ravine runs south to north into a misty plain where it disappears out of sight. To the northwest, clinging to the edge of the ravine, there is an old ruin...a castle. Only part of the ruin is visible as the rest of it fades into gray mist. She turns westward and sinks down in the ravine. Making her way north, the tip of her left wing nearly strokes the far ravine wall. She turns upwards and flies clockwise around the entire castle ruin. Most of the old castle is gone. As she is viewing it from the outside she can see chambers, dungeons and rooms in several levels that are exposed. The rest of the ruin is at the bottom of the ravine. After flying through the mist on the far side of the ruin, she appears at a great wall that separates the castle grounds from the northern wastelands before turning southeast. In the southeast corner of the big desolate field the ground slopes down and turns into a ragged hole in the ground. Heat ripples the air around it. A large fire burns within a ring of stones. She circles the fire. She is in a hurry, searching for the thing that should be but is no longer. She returns to the ruin. There is a high wall east of the castle and she stops to rest on top of it. The world wavers its way back to reality and Lornedei looks pale and a bit unsteady on her feet. "Too high! Master? If I die and must come back, please do not make me a bird!"There is nothing she can do from here. She may be able to reach a distant object, but she can do nothing with it. Lornedei bites on a nail.

"Nasty, nasty things. Let me just rest girl, just for a moment." Lornedei watches the black forest for a moment, waiting for the firefly to calm down. When the little creature talks again, it seems to have regained its composure. It lifts off and starts circling Lornedei. "The nasty forest has secrets. It might tell you if you look beyond. You must reach inside it to get knowledge girl. So many secrets are everywhere in this forest, and the other forest, leaves and rocks and the beasts living there."

Flesh grows and shapes itself in the shell into an insect's body. The mush is white with brown and dark red streaks. The nasty mess is swirling around inside the leaf, forming the flesh bit by bit. The shiny wetness dries quickly once the beetle's body takes form inside its shell. A thin purple layer finally covers the belly. Six black legs pop out through the newly formed glittering layer of skin. It takes only a moment for them to start moving around. Another pop forces a wriggling head out and the insect is near completion. The bug grows at a furious pace and finally it extrudes a pair of black antennae that unfold until they're as long, if not longer, than the entire beetle. Lornedei turns the beetle over.

For a moment there is nothing but a shimmering mist all around, but then three shapes appear in the distance. They are trees. This she is sure of. Giant trees. They are somehow out of focus and no matter how she strains, they remain that way. The only thing clear about the shapes is the color of the mist surrounding them. They are surrounded by green, black, and gold. Suddenly the golden tree fades, leaving the mist behind. The black tree grows, and the green one appears to cower under it. Lornedei's vision fades. Lornedei's magic drops by one. [ACTION] take urn

[ACTION] up [STATE] Hall of Elevation (In the Giant Oak) A soft warm breeze catches Lornedei's hair when she finally reaches a branch. It is, in fact, the first branch she gets to and the only one she can reach. It's as thick as a well-fed pig and she swings one leg over it. She ends up sitting with her face towards the trunk. Above her is an enormous and glittering green ceiling that is the crown of the oak. She looks up. The endless movements of the countless leaves trick her into swaying with them. That is, until she nearly loses her balance. She grabs the branch and focuses instead on the unmoving trunk. A pale shadow of a smile touches her lips when she quickly glances up at you. The shadow of the big oak trembles on the ground below. The far end of the branch Lornedei is sitting on seems to disappear in a gray mist. The other two branches on this level are just as unreachable for her as the limbs higher up. In the trunk in front of her, three holes are lined up in a tidy row. They are apparently inhabited by some kind of worm. She can climb down or go north along the branch. A fat blue worm quickly crawls over to the third hole. The beetle scrambles out of its confinement. It sits motionless but trembling on Lornedei's shoulder, making a strange hissing noise. After a moment of that, it scrambles down to the branch, utters that strange hissing again, louder this time. One of the worms sticks its head out and hisses back at the beetle. It makes a very hasty retreat back in the hole though. [ACTION] examine holes

A low squeaking makes Lornedei turn around. The sound stops. The skinny worm starts biting the moist tangle of roots. One after another get to feel the starved fury of the yellow worm. The roots start to shake violently to get rid of the furiously eating worm. Big pieces of moist wood are torn from the roots. Some disappear down the worm's seemingly bottomless stomach. Most, however, drop in the water. Eventually, the tree gives in. The roots move aside, revealing a passage south into darkness. Lornedei picks up the worm that oddly enough looks no less skinny now.

[Your holiness has just gone up by five.] [ACTION] south [STATE] After squeezing herself through the tight passage she is not just dripping wet but also filthy and out of breath. Hall of Severance Slowly, Lornedei looks around this dark clearing. An oppressive gray fog hangs over everything and seems to add weight to the air itself. There is a presence here. Something is waiting among the dark trees. Something sinister. The gray mist hides the sun from sight and there is no way to make out which direction is which. The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across. It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides. A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing. Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way up. A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow in a loose circle around the oak and the altar. An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house. On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden forest. The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a passage. A greenish fog seeps out of the darkness between the trees. Lazily it gathers itself until a green pillar of mist is formed. It glides slowly over the dead grass and stops next to Lornedei. It starts to spin. Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her ear. The beetle squirms its way out of Lornedei's grasp and drops to the ground. It runs off, climbs up on the stone well, climbs back down, crawls through the bushes and seems to inspect the stone house, to finally stop at one of the paths. [ACTION] examine green mist

[STATE] A stubby pillar of greenish fog hovers just above ground level. It spins around its own axis like a slow motion whirlwind. [ACTION] enter house [STATE] Hall of Severance (In the House of Penance) Lornedei steps through the crumbling opening into a darkness that is not quite total. There is dim light sifting down from the ruined ceiling above. She glances up, perhaps fearing that the whole construction will give up at her intrusion. But the only thing falling down on her is the weight of history; stories of cruel ignorance, memories that linger. The light catches a glittering thread and Lornedei swipes at the descending spider before it can land on her. With a grimace she steps on it before it can scramble away, burying it in the dry dirt. She looks around, but if there are more spiders here, they keep out of her way. The many years have taken its toll on this house. The circular wall tapers slightly towards the ceiling. Above her, a framework of thick beams support several generations worth of spider webs. There is not much left of the roof now. The light from outside leaks in through the holes in the ceiling. It magnifies the presence of fine dry dust that floats lazily in the still air. Long since rotted straw and reeds cover the earthen floor. A pair of rusty manacles hangs on the wall. "Master?"

A shriek cuts through the still air and she takes a step back. Empty sockets in a yellowed and cracked skull stare up at her. She takes another step towards the opening and starts to turn to leave. Something causes her to look back, though, perhaps a sense of shame for disturbing this final resting place. She stares at the human skull peeking out from its shallow grave, and goes to cover it again. Before she can throw a handful of the old straw over it, she stops. There is a sudden glimmering light from within one of the dark holes. There is something inside the skull. She also notices a small pouch in the shallow grave, half buried in the dirt.

[ACTION] reach skull [STATE] Lornedei places a hand lightly on the skull and shuts her eyes. A low sound escapes her tightly closed lips. The final moments of a girl's life spill into her mind. An already pale face turns ash gray and she trembles, tries to pull her hand away, but cannot. "No! No please." The screams have lost their strength and turned to whispers, gurgling coughing, and inaudible pleading. Now they are only in her mind. She knows there will be no mercy. She tries to turn to the side on the hard ground, tries to spit the teeth out before they choke her, but another blow forces her head the other way. Someone is holding her legs down. She cannot pull them up, bring them together, cannot get rid of the weight. Something else is pushing down on her stomach, a boot, and she cannot turn, barely breathe. Something is holding her hands, but then one comes free. She lifts it to her face. The next thing that breaks are four of her fingers along with her nose, the nose that is underneith the hand. There are four of them. They take turns with her, sharing the pleasure of beating her with the rock. They take turns using her body, the part of her body that is not yet covered in blood. She cannot see them. What slits might be left to see through have filled with blood. She has no wish to see. She knows it will be over soon, very soon. There is no salvation, no hope of rescue, but in the end there is no longer any pain. When Anadei's body is used up and is systematically broken up, the way it is told it should be done, she is long gone. Lornedei reels back from the skull, turns, and staggers away from you. She leans forward and struggles to avoid being sick. You watch her with clinical curiosity. Can this young and soft girl, in the end, do what you need her to do? Can she banish the evil and then bring back the old ways? The old beliefs? Perhaps even the old rituals could be revived. You must think this over as time moves on. For now, you turn your attention to the task at hand. Lornedei is watching you. She is pale but composed. "Her name was Anadei, daughter of Meredea. She was the last of the light bearers Master. They feared her so much that she was ordered dead." Lornedei laughs dryly and continues with a cynicism very unlike her. "I guess they completed that task, but that is not all they did." She shudders and will not say more on the subject. Lornedei's magic just dropped by five. [ACTION] bury skull

Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way up. A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow in a loose circle around the oak and the altar. An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house. On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden forest.

Lornedei folds herself over the branch and stays hanging precariously over it. She looks down. The clearing below her swims out of focus, seems to move away from her and then come rushing back at her. She clings desperately to the scorched limb, unsure if she is going to slide backwards and down on the ground, or tip over forward with the same fatal result. She shuts her eyes hard. And the world is still once more. Very carefully, she lifts one leg over the branch and then she is sitting steady. She opens her eyes and with a sigh of relief. The clearing looks as it should, all considering. Clusters of black leaves surround Lornedei. They hang from the upper branches, creating a shield that totally obscures the sky above. She can look down, as all the clusters are above and around her, but up is nothing but shimmering black. The branch reaches out over the clearing and the end of it seems to disappear in a big cloud of smoke. She can climb down to the ground or follow the branch. [ACTION] reach smoke

With a screech, the fly buzzes off to sit on the stone house roof. "The same you are not Girl. I know not if you can be trusted Girl." Lornedei picks up a rock and throws it at the fly that buzzes off to sit on the stone altar. "Will you listen Girl?" Lornedei crosses her arms and glares at the fly. After a moment's indecision, she nods. The fly moves to the edge of the altar and pauses a moment. "You have met one of Raccdaha's minions I see. You must have set it free. Shame. Such shame. Do not believe him Girl! Raccdaha is not strong enough now to possess you from where he is hiding, but he lets his lesser demons do his bidding. Do not believe the messages he sends!" Lornedei takes a step forward and raises a hand to swat the fly, but the fly is already sitting in the black oak. "Oh dear, temper, temper.

[Your holiness has just gone up by five.] [ACTION] take black leaf [STATE] Lornedei grabs one of the black leaves in the nearest cluster and twists it loose from the branch.

When it is done growing, it crawls up on Lornedei's shoulder. [ACTION] give beetle to raven [STATE] Lornedei holds the beetle in a tight grip, and shows it to the bird. The black bird leans its head to one side. Most interested, it moves restlessly on its branch. Lornedei slowly puts the beetle on the ground. She steps back and waits. The beetle turns towards Lornedei, turns back, notices the bird and makes a run for it. It heads for the high grass. The hungry bird dives from the tree and drops in a cloud of dirt between the bug and the safe undergrowth. The beetle stops dead in its track, changes direction and rushes forward, but the bird is already there, flipping the bug over. For one moment, it is immobilized. That moment is enough. While the beetle is helpless, the bird gets to the eating. Big chunks of the insect's body is ripped out and swallowed. At some point, the legs and antennae stop moving. Finally, there is nothing left of the beetle but an empty shell, lined with a few sad remains of legs, flesh, and unidentifiable insect parts. The bird skips along the path where, if one looks hard enough, one can see another trail. The bird turns to Lornedei and croaks. Waiting.

[Your holiness has just gone up by five.] [ACTION] follow raven [STATE] Lornedei dares a careful step towards the black bird. It turns and hops along the path a short distance before it again faces the girl. Waiting. Lornedei takes another step and the bird takes off in the air. It flies in circles in front of her, high up and almost out of sight at times but always close enough for Lornedei to follow. The path winds its way through and around the disturbing shadows of the forbidden forest. Fallen trees and dense undergrowth is constantly in her way and she has to climb over, through, or around these obstacles, while keeping an eye on the bird. It is just ahead and above her. She follows the black bird, expecting the cold grip of the forgotten ones around her ankles at any moment. Images of soul wrenching, flesh ripping, and blood drinking spirits run through her mind. Nothing happens. Exhausted and bruised, with her clothes torn and dusty, she stumbles on. Something grabs her foot; she loses her balance and falls forward with a painful thud. Frozen in a breathless heap on the ground, she takes a moment to gather her strength as well as her breath. The bird croaks, Light seeps in through her closed eyelids. She looks up in time to catch a final glimpse of the bird. It disappears into a glowing sunset beyond a desolate field. Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair) Slowly Lornedei gets up on her feet. Nearly blinded by the light from the dying sun, she inspects the damage. She sighs deeply. She opens her mouth to speak again but the words never come. She takes in the view of this seemingly empty wasteland in shocked silence for some time. She swallows. A dry wind tugs at her clothing while playing restlessly in the dry ground. Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the uniform gray ahead. The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon. Lornedei turns her head slowly from side to side, dazed. She blinks. [Your holiness has just gone up by five.] [ACTION] east

This is the southeastern corner of the field of despair. The forbidden forest is nearly all around her. West, northwest, and north takes her out. The ground sinks into a large hole, a bowl more than fifty paces across, in the ground, edged by crevices and uneven ridges. A broken land. Once at the bottom, the rest of the field is out of sight. A stone circle is laid out on the ground. There is a fire inside the ring of stones, blasting out heat and light. Shadows cast by the stones stretch out from the circle.

[STATE] Castle Ruins (In the Hall of Mirrors) Silence, perfect stillness, a sense of waiting. As soon as Lornedei steps past the statue, the sensation overwhelms her. For once, she is silent for a long while before making her remark. "What a mess!" The chamber seems to have survived the devastation of the castle with only minor damages though. Sand and scattered pieces of marble lie beneath a few cracks in one corner. This chamber is over ten paces across and perfectly square. A large oval mirror dominates each wall. Four mirrors. North, west, south and east. Lornedei came in from the northwest. An old burned out torch sits askew on the south wall. A big pile of stone and steel takes up a large part of the space in the middle of the floor. "Who would bring that junk down here? Seems very strange to me." Lornedei stumbles on a big staff on the floor. She barely avoids stepping on a sad looking long dead somebody. The dead somebody seems to be the owner of the staff. "I believe that this might be one of the Elders." [Your holiness has just gone up by five.] [ACTION] examine elder [STATE] Lornedei bends down to take a look at the grim pile of bones.

Slowly, the rocks rearrange themselves, moving into place with a grinding noise that causes the entire chamber to vibrate. Triangular metal pieces covered in rust and dust, although they seem sharp enough, align themselves in two rows. Some of the smaller rocks, scattered around the periphery of the pile, skip and hop along the dusty floor until they are also in place. There is a loud bang as the two largest pieces come together. The noise gets louder as hundreds of rocks of all sizes and rusty pieces of metal move into place, all at the same time. For a heartbeat, everything is still.

[ACTION] down [STATE] Lornedei climbs down. Hall of Severance The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across. It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides. A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing. Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way up. A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow in a loose circle around the oak and the altar. An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house. On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden forest. The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a passage. The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly. Black smoke seeps out of the darkness between the trees. The smoke gathers itself until a dark pillar of smoke is formed. In erratic, twitching moves, it comes closer. It stops next to the staring Lornedei. It starts to turn slowly, releasing veils of broken smoke from its ragged surface. They dissolve in the air and new ones form to take their place. "The maker of horrors at night. The roaming nightmare. I thought they were stories." Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening. And there truly is a sound, distant, from the forest.

It is floating just above ground level. It spins around its own axis like a slow motion whirlwind. There is an angry buzzing from nearby. Lornedei looks around, mystified. "Pft, which is it, oh smelly it is. Stubborn, umpf, thing." Suddenly, the firefly comes out of the opening to the stone house, dragging a piece of straw. One end of it touches the ground while the other end, with the firefly in unsteady flight through the air, is at level with Lornedei's knees. "Hiya!" With a terrible boost of tiny wings, the fly gets the straw totally off the ground and stays hovering at eye level. "Oh dear, you are back." The fly and the straw, despite intense buzzing, starts to sink. Quickly, Lornedei grabs the straw and stops it from falling. "Phew! Thankee Girl. Let me rest. Was waiting for you." Lornedei sticks the end of the straw in her hair so that the other end sticks out in front of her face. After a moment, the fly starts pacing the piece of straw. "You were in the smoke were you not? I feared you being lost Girl. Oh, dear. I must tell a story now. About a little boy." Lornedei sits down on the ground to listen. "He is an ugly one, if you can say so about a spirit. He was not always so. He was a boy once, born in a village not far from yours. That was a long time ago you see. An odd child he was, yes he was. He sat by the pond for much time, lost in the sight of his own face in the water, catching..." the fly stops pacing for a moment and seems to shudder. "I heard from rumor I did don't you know, He caught fireflies and he... He pulled...Oh, dear, I will not speak of that. He was wicked! Then his parents died. He was alone and he took care of himself. How, no one could tell, as he was still only a little boy. Then the magician came. The villagers were relieved to see the boy go with him, and no one knows where they went. For many years the boy was gone, yes he was. When he came back, a young man with riches and fancy ways, he moved in to the old home of his family, and said he had gotten rich from trade in the far lands and wished to set up business in his home village." The firefly makes an angry buzzing and starts pacing the straw again. "I must make this story of less length I believe. He did not make trade honestly, tricks he had, power he had gained and fooled the villagers he did, and rose to a man of importance despite him being still young. Then his gaze fell on the merchant's daughter, and he wished her for himself. There was nothing but desire in his mind and when the girl's father refused him the still too young girl, a spell was cast. With magic he tried to force her to him, but something went wrong, very wrong." "The spell he cast was powerful. The girl ran from her father in desperation one night, threw herself on a horse and rode for her love. She was in a hurry and fell. The girl was several years younger than you Girl, and the Elder's knew something was amiss. They traced the magic spell to Raccdaha. The Elder's council banished him from the village and from his own body in the ancient sentence of severance. Death but no rest. A very cruel punishment and Raccdaha was in fact the last one they kept in the House of Penance. He became one of the forgotten ones, chased into the vast forest. He did not remain forgotten though. He remembered his name as some of them might if they are strong enough. He grew strong. The hatred he felt poisoned big parts of the old forest and gave some kind of life to the other forgotten souls that dwelled there. He fed the spirits with lies and promises of life. When they finally felt the same rage as him, he fed on their collective hatred and he could possess a poor wanderer's body for a while. Before his temporary body was used up, he joined the light bearers without them knowing. Their numbers started to decrease until there was very few left. He spread lies. The people grew afraid of magic, and the remaining light bearers had only one place to go. From their castle in the field of Unification, they tried to maintain the three great oaks for many years, but the day came when they had to flee even that haven. Me, cannot tell where they fled, or how. Perhaps if you go there, the place is now the field of despair, you could find knowledge. Me, yes me I don't know the rest of this story, only that Raccdaha came to rest somewhere, not able to move on, not able to live. I believe that he may be guarding the entrance to somewhere where he cannot go, waiting." The firefly is quiet for a long moment. Then it walks over to the end of the straw and with a powerful buzzing, the straw is dislodged from Lornedei's hair. The fly pipes up again. "I will be off. Good luck Girl, he may be strong but remember that he is only a big foolish and vain child." The fly and the straw disappear with a flash, leaving a scent of burnt straw in the air.

Hall of Severance The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across. It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides. A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing. Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way up. A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow in a loose circle around the oak and the altar. An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house. On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden forest. The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a passage. The nightmare is here, spinning slowly.

She gathers her powers and lets a thin blue streak of light touch the glass fragments. A sudden rumble makes her turn around, loosing the connection with the magic. The statue slides back over the opening in the wall. The sound of it drowns in a loud grinding noise. Steel against steel. The sound turns into a scream, a guttural growl. Lornedei staggers backwards as the floor shakes. The big pile of steel and stone stands before Lornedei with every seemingly random part now in its right place. The creature is almost twice as tall as the girl, and it stares down at her from within a diffuse darkness that surrounds it. This darkness is the force keeping all of its parts together and enabling the heavy body to move. An enormous head sits directly on a giant shoulder, and the jaw of rusty metal opens and closes constantly with a creaking and a clank that echoes in the chamber. The enormous body of stone shifts constantly, as if restless. The sound of stone grinding against stone, steel against stone and steel against steel is terribly loud. A crimson glow pulsates deep in a horizontal crack in the head. Puffs of dust fly out of the many joints between the rocks. Tufts of mold, moss, and shards of stone are raining down on the marble floor. Lornedei's magic drops by one. Clouds of dust swirl up around stomping stone feet. [ACTION] inventory

A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing. Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way up. A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow in a loose circle around the oak and the altar. An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house. On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden forest. The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a passage. The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly. Black smoke seeps out of the darkness between the trees. The smoke gathers itself until a dark pillar of smoke is formed. In erratic, twitching moves, it comes closer. It stops next to the staring Lornedei. It starts to turn slowly, releasing veils of broken smoke from its ragged surface. They dissolve in the air and new ones form to take their place. "The maker of horrors at night.

A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing. Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way up. A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow in a loose circle around the oak and the altar. An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house. On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden forest. The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a passage. The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly. Black smoke seeps out of the darkness between the trees. The smoke gathers itself until a dark pillar of smoke is formed. In erratic, twitching moves, it comes closer. It stops next to the staring Lornedei. It starts to turn slowly, releasing veils of broken smoke from its ragged surface. They dissolve in the air and new ones form to take their place. "The maker of horrors at night. The roaming nightmare. I thought they were stories." [ACTION] enter nightmare [STATE] "Master? Are you sure about this?" She looks terrified but she decides to trust your judgment. She walks into the spinning smoke. the nightmare stops spinning and Lornedei appears on the other side. She looks at you with gray eyes and an uncanny smile on her lips. There is an angry buzzing from nearby. Lornedei looks around, mystified. "Pft, which is it, oh smelly it is. Stubborn, umpf, thing." Suddenly, the firefly comes out of the opening to the stone house, dragging a piece of straw. One end of it touches the ground while the other end, with the firefly in unsteady flight through the air, is at level with Lornedei's knees. "Hiya!" With a terrible boost of tiny wings, the fly gets the straw totally off the ground and stays hovering at eye level. "Oh dear, you are back." The fly and the straw, despite intense buzzing, starts to sink. Quickly, Lornedei grabs the straw and stops it from falling. "Phew! Thankee Girl. Let me rest. Was waiting for you." Lornedei sticks the end of the straw in her hair so that the other end sticks out in front of her face. After a moment, the fly starts pacing the piece of straw. "You were in the smoke were you not? I feared you being lost Girl. Oh, dear. I must tell a story now. About a little boy." Lornedei sits down on the ground to listen. "He is an ugly one, if you can say so about a spirit. He was not always so. He was a boy once, born in a village not far from yours. That was a long time ago you see. An odd child he was, yes he was. He sat by the pond for much time, lost in the sight of his own face in the water, catching..." the fly stops pacing for a moment and seems to shudder. "I heard from rumor I did don't you know, He caught fireflies and he... He pulled...Oh, dear, I will not speak of that. He was wicked! Then his parents died. He was alone and he took care of himself. How, no one could tell, as he was still only a little boy. Then the magician came. The villagers were relieved to see the boy go with him, and no one knows where they went. For many years the boy was gone, yes he was. When he came back, a young man with riches and fancy ways, he moved in to the old home of his family, and said he had gotten rich from trade in the far lands and wished to set up business in his home village." The firefly makes an angry buzzing and starts pacing the straw again. "I must make this story of less length I believe. He did not make trade honestly, tricks he had, power he had gained and fooled the villagers he did, and rose to a man of importance despite him being still young. Then his gaze fell on the merchant's daughter, and he wished her for himself. There was nothing but desire in his mind and when the girl's father refused him the still too young girl, a spell was cast. With magic he tried to force her to him, but something went wrong, very wrong." "The spell he cast was powerful. The girl ran from her father in desperation one night, threw herself on a horse and rode for her love. She was in a hurry and fell. The girl was several years younger than you Girl, and the Elder's knew something was amiss. They traced the magic spell to Raccdaha. The Elder's council banished him from the village and from his own body in the ancient sentence of severance. Death but no rest. A very cruel punishment and Raccdaha was in fact the last one they kept in the House of Penance. He became one of the forgotten ones, chased into the vast forest. He did not remain forgotten though. He remembered his name as some of them might if they are strong enough. He grew strong. The hatred he felt poisoned big parts of the old forest and gave some kind of life to the other forgotten souls that dwelled there. He fed the spirits with lies and promises of life. When they finally felt the same rage as him, he fed on their collective hatred and he could possess a poor wanderer's body for a while. Before his temporary body was used up, he joined the light bearers without them knowing. Their numbers started to decrease until there was very few left. He spread lies. The people grew afraid of magic, and the remaining light bearers had only one place to go. From their castle in the field of Unification, they tried to maintain the three great oaks for many years, but the day came when they had to flee even that haven. Me, cannot tell where they fled, or how. Perhaps if you go there, the place is now the field of despair, you could find knowledge. Me, yes me I don't know the rest of this story, only that Raccdaha came to rest somewhere, not able to move on, not able to live. I believe that he may be guarding the entrance to somewhere where he cannot go, waiting." The firefly is quiet for a long moment. Then it walks over to the end of the straw and with a powerful buzzing, the straw is dislodged from Lornedei's hair. The fly pipes up again. "I will be off. Good luck Girl, he may be strong but remember that he is only a big foolish and vain child." The fly and the straw disappear with a flash, leaving a scent of burnt straw in the air. Lornedei is muttering to herself. Lornedei turns her head slowly from side to side, dazed. She blinks. [ACTION] up

[ACTION] down [STATE] Lornedei climbs down. Hall of Severance The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across. It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides. A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing. Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way up. A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow in a loose circle around the oak and the altar. An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house. On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden forest. The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a passage. There is an angry buzzing from nearby. Lornedei looks around, mystified. "Pft, which is it, oh smelly it is. Stubborn, umpf, thing." Suddenly, the firefly comes out of the opening to the stone house, dragging a piece of straw. One end of it touches the ground while the other end, with the firefly in unsteady flight through the air, is at level with Lornedei's knees. "Hiya!" With a terrible boost of tiny wings, the fly gets the straw totally off the ground and stays hovering at eye level. "Oh dear, you are back." The fly and the straw, despite intense buzzing, starts to sink. Quickly, Lornedei grabs the straw and stops it from falling. "Phew! Thankee Girl. Let me rest. Was waiting for you." Lornedei sticks the end of the straw in her hair so that the other end sticks out in front of her face. After a moment, the fly starts pacing the piece of straw. "You were in the smoke were you not? I feared you being lost Girl. Oh, dear. I must tell a story now. About a little boy." Lornedei sits down on the ground to listen. "He is an ugly one, if you can say so about a spirit. He was not always so. He was a boy once, born in a village not far from yours. That was a long time ago you see. An odd child he was, yes he was. He sat by the pond for much time, lost in the sight of his own face in the water, catching..." the fly stops pacing for a moment and seems to shudder. "I heard from rumor I did don't you know, He caught fireflies and he... He pulled...Oh, dear, I will not speak of that. He was wicked! Then his parents died. He was alone and he took care of himself. How, no one could tell, as he was still only a little boy. Then the magician came. The villagers were relieved to see the boy go with him, and no one knows where they went. For many years the boy was gone, yes he was. When he came back, a young man with riches and fancy ways, he moved in to the old home of his family, and said he had gotten rich from trade in the far lands and wished to set up business in his home village." The firefly makes an angry buzzing and starts pacing the straw again. "I must make this story of less length I believe. He did not make trade honestly, tricks he had, power he had gained and fooled the villagers he did, and rose to a man of importance despite him being still young. Then his gaze fell on the merchant's daughter, and he wished her for himself. There was nothing but desire in his mind and when the girl's father refused him the still too young girl, a spell was cast. With magic he tried to force her to him, but something went wrong, very wrong." "The spell he cast was powerful. The girl ran from her father in desperation one night, threw herself on a horse and rode for her love. She was in a hurry and fell. The girl was several years younger than you Girl, and the Elder's knew something was amiss. They traced the magic spell to Raccdaha. The Elder's council banished him from the village and from his own body in the ancient sentence of severance. Death but no rest. A very cruel punishment and Raccdaha was in fact the last one they kept in the House of Penance. He became one of the forgotten ones, chased into the vast forest. He did not remain forgotten though. He remembered his name as some of them might if they are strong enough. He grew strong. The hatred he felt poisoned big parts of the old forest and gave some kind of life to the other forgotten souls that dwelled there. He fed the spirits with lies and promises of life. When they finally felt the same rage as him, he fed on their collective hatred and he could possess a poor wanderer's body for a while. Before his temporary body was used up, he joined the light bearers without them knowing. Their numbers started to decrease until there was very few left. He spread lies. The people grew afraid of magic, and the remaining light bearers had only one place to go. From their castle in the field of Unification, they tried to maintain the three great oaks for many years, but the day came when they had to flee even that haven. Me, cannot tell where they fled, or how. Perhaps if you go there, the place is now the field of despair, you could find knowledge. Me, yes me I don't know the rest of this story, only that Raccdaha came to rest somewhere, not able to move on, not able to live. I believe that he may be guarding the entrance to somewhere where he cannot go, waiting." The firefly is quiet for a long moment. Then it walks over to the end of the straw and with a powerful buzzing, the straw is dislodged from Lornedei's hair. The fly pipes up again. "I will be off. Good luck Girl, he may be strong but remember that he is only a big foolish and vain child." The fly and the straw disappear with a flash, leaving a scent of burnt straw in the air. The sleepwalker comes charging out of the forest in a hurry. It stops next to Lornedei, disposing of sand, leaves and sticks, dead grass and not just a little dry soil. The wandering nightmare crashes out from the black forest. It swirls up dust and dry grass on its erratic route through the dead grass. It twitches past the altar and stops near the black oak. The beetle squirms its way out of Lornedei's grasp and drops to the ground. It runs off, climbs up on the stone well, climbs back down, crawls through the bushes and seems to inspect the stone house, to finally stop at one of the paths. [ACTION] look

Southwest would take her back to the edge of the forest where she first entered the field. Lornedei wipes her forehead with her shirtsleeve. [ACTION] dig [STATE] What do you want Lornedei to dig?

[STATE] If you insist. [ACTION] put nut in hole [STATE] Lornedei inspects the nut carefully. She looks pleased. She plants the nut in the ground, flattens the soil over the nut and steps back. She smiles expectantly and lifts one hand. She turns it over and lets a blue spark appear. It turns to red as she focuses on it, and then she blows it towards her little patch of garden. The wind suddenly changes direction. It seems to come from everywhere now, focusing on the thorn that slowly grows out of the ground, feeding it. Lornedei looks up. The mist follows the wind, billowing like clouds towards the new tree. A turmoil of gray soon covers the entire field, tightens, grows heavy, and darkness falls. The single thorn grows, pointing straight up towards the mist, and the ground seems restless under Lornedei's feet. The mist sinks further to meet the thorn, a greasy black spike, taller than Lornedei now and growing still. A small slit opens up at the base of the spike. it oozes a black liquid before a smaller spike is thrust straight out of it, barely missing Lornedei. More slits appear and more of these spiked branches come to be. The "tree" continues to grow. The base is now two paces wide and suddenly the earth cracks around it. The spikes, more than thirty now, reach out several paces in every direction, twisting and deforming as they grow. The glistening black skin cracks and oozes more black sap, and thorns starts to grow from these as well. The crack in the stone widens, but the spike clings to the rock that isn't moving. It doesn't lose its grip as the spike grows down more than up, creating an enormous pillar going down in the mist and out of sight. The crack widens further and the ground shakes violently. With an enormous rumble and screaming stone, everything north of the spike falls out of sight in the deepening mist. At the same time in the Hall of Unification, a lush oak shudders as gray mist darkens the sky. In the village, the ground trembles and the blacksmith tries in vain to calm the horse he is putting new shoes on. Over the Aarkland river, the forgotten ones follow the mist that rolls out over the billowing field and the road. The villagers on the streets, on their porches, glancing out the door to call in their children for supper, fall silent. All look up at the sky to the northwest as the mist rolls closer.

A shiver runs through her body and the stone and steel is suddenly gone, replaced with a torch lit smooth marble floor. The room is full of people, all of them looking at the west mirror. They are nothing but diffuse memories of this chamber as it was, as it used to be, but the tension in the group is clear. Flickering torches on the walls light up the chamber, creating illusive shadows across frightened faces. The silent spirits seem to hesitate. They talk hastily among themselves, casting nervous looks into the mirror and over their shoulders. The mirror in this vision is whole and shows a picture of a giant golden oak. The image is fading with each breath. Several of the people in the crowd stagger as if the floor itself is moving. An old man raises a staff towards the mirror, uttering a string of words that catch the attention of the group. A young woman picks up a silently crying child in her arms, looks around the chamber and walks through the mirror. The rest of the crowd quickly follows her until only the old man remains. He takes a step towards the mirror but then he stops. Something that Lornedei is unable to see looms over him. His eyes widen in horror and his mouth opens in a silent scream. He raises his staff against the oncoming threat with a thin shaking hand. He knows the end is close as a shadow falls over his pale face. Several long moments he stands still, facing the danger while speaking words that cannot be heard, holding the staff in front of him. The horror in his eyes grows with each meaningless attack. His back straightens as the answer comes to him. Instead of fighting a futile battle, he turns to the mirror. He swings his staff with full force at the mirror. The glittering image disappears.

The big pile of steel and stone stands before Lornedei with every seemingly random part now in its right place. The creature is almost twice as tall as the girl, and it stares down at her from within a diffuse darkness that surrounds it. This darkness is the force keeping all of its parts together and enabling the heavy body to move. An enormous head sits directly on a giant shoulder, and the jaw of rusty metal opens and closes constantly with a creaking and a clank that echoes in the chamber. The enormous body of stone shifts constantly, as if restless. The sound of stone grinding against stone, steel against stone and steel against steel is terribly loud. A crimson glow pulsates deep in a horizontal crack in the head. Puffs of dust fly out of the many joints between the rocks. Tufts of mold, moss, and shards of stone are raining down on the marble floor. Lornedei's magic drops by one. [ACTION] look

[ACTION] throw spider at raccdaha [STATE] Taking advantage of the distraction, Lornedei moves closer to Raccdaha with the crystal spider in her hand. The crystal spider jerks to life and jumps from her hand. A sparkling light flares up around it. The light grows stronger and Lornedei has to throw her hands up in front of her face to keep the blinding light from her eyes. As she steps back, she stumbles on the pile of bones and drops hard on the marble. A roar echoes in the chamber and the floor shakes. Raccdaha is moving away from Lornedei, trying to back away from the small creature of light. The spider is growing. Soon it is doubling, tripling, and quadrupling its size, becoming brighter each second. It glows furiously, the light pulsating as it keeps growing. the roaring increases and turns from rage into fear. Raccdaha is trying to shield itself from the light, but the light is everywhere. It throws its arms at the spider to crush it. It gets a hold of one leg of the spider, and with a sharp explosion, it pulverizes the leg. But the spider is already where it wants to be. The spider wraps its remaining legs around Raccdaha's head, obscuring it entirely. Raccdaha's trashing is slowly fading. The crushing arms have lost their aim and the few blows hitting the spider make little damage. A cloud of pulverized crystal sparkles in the pulsating light. The crimson light flares up through the spider's body, but it has no effect on the spider. The creature's head is now only a blinding light, and the swirling darkness starts to melt away from the rock. The roar of terror from the creature changes into a howling shriek that comes from everywhere. The sound cuts through Lornedei's mind and soul. Then the horrible scream is not just one. There are now hundreds, thousands of howling screams of terror and pain filling the chamber. The light from the crystal spider travels to the tips of the stone fingers on both hands and down the legs. As the light covers one stone foot and reaches to cover the final glimpse of gray mossy rock on the other foot, the screaming climbs in volume further. Then it stops, leaving only a ringing in Lornedei's ears. Finally, the darkness that held the stone limbs together is gone. The spider is gone, the light is fading and for a moment, Raccdaha stays upright. Then it falls into a pile of stone and steel. Lornedei hears the crash, but it is as if she hears it through water. The ringing is still loud in her head. She steps forward, and now the pile is actually nothing but stone and rusted steel covered with a layer of crystal dust.

A sparkling light flares up around it. The light grows stronger and Lornedei has to throw her hands up in front of her face to keep the blinding light from her eyes. As she steps back, she stumbles on the pile of bones and drops hard on the marble. A roar echoes in the chamber and the floor shakes. Raccdaha is moving away from Lornedei, trying to back away from the small creature of light. The spider is growing. Soon it is doubling, tripling, and quadrupling its size, becoming brighter each second. It glows furiously, the light pulsating as it keeps growing. the roaring increases and turns from rage into fear. Raccdaha is trying to shield itself from the light, but the light is everywhere. It throws its arms at the spider to crush it. It gets a hold of one leg of the spider, and with a sharp explosion, it pulverizes the leg. But the spider is already where it wants to be. The spider wraps its remaining legs around Raccdaha's head, obscuring it entirely. Raccdaha's trashing is slowly fading. The crushing arms have lost their aim and the few blows hitting the spider make little damage. A cloud of pulverized crystal sparkles in the pulsating light. The crimson light flares up through the spider's body, but it has no effect on the spider. The creature's head is now only a blinding light, and the swirling darkness starts to melt away from the rock. The roar of terror from the creature changes into a howling shriek that comes from everywhere. The sound cuts through Lornedei's mind and soul. Then the horrible scream is not just one. There are now hundreds, thousands of howling screams of terror and pain filling the chamber. The light from the crystal spider travels to the tips of the stone fingers on both hands and down the legs. As the light covers one stone foot and reaches to cover the final glimpse of gray mossy rock on the other foot, the screaming climbs in volume further. Then it stops, leaving only a ringing in Lornedei's ears. Finally, the darkness that held the stone limbs together is gone. The spider is gone, the light is fading and for a moment, Raccdaha stays upright. Then it falls into a pile of stone and steel. Lornedei hears the crash, but it is as if she hears it through water. The ringing is still loud in her head. She steps forward, and now the pile is actually nothing but stone and rusted steel covered with a layer of crystal dust. A glimmer catches her eye and she notices something golden lying among the stones.

The crystal dust rises, then floats above the pile of steel and stones. It spreads out in the chamber before surrounding Lornedei. The swirling dust stays motionless in the air for a few moments. Lornedei waits without fear. Then it reaches for her, entering her. She takes an involuntary breath and in an instant, the shimmering dust is gone. An enormous surge of power runs through her body. The ringing in her head disappears. Every bruise and cut she received this day fades and disappears. Lornedei is still, closing her eyes for a moment. Then she laughs aloud. "The light bearers will come back now. There is only one thing left to do." Lornedei's magic just went up... Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip. [ACTION] magic
