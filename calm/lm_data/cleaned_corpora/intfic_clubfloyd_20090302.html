You hear a distorted voice announce "lxprog complete." The view becomes thin, and the last thing you see before you black out is snow. You can vaguely feel and hear the sensations and sounds of being grabbed and carried, of voices in confusion, and of a gigantic explosion, but the first time you truly awake is at... Grassy Field Green surrounds your vision from this vantage point, on the top of a plateau. High above you, the stars shine brightly, and the two moons cast their glow all over the surface of the field. You see a tall man sitting next to a tree. The man notices you awaking and motions for you to stay seated. "The transfer to your real body has put you through much strain, especially since I had to speed up the program a little." You have the extreme urge to say something, but your mouth is unable to move. Your entire body is exhausted. "I know what you want to ask. You want to know why I saved you. I thought perhaps I could get someone to understand the true nature of the war, and after such a situation you may understand without me even telling you." The man studies you in silence for a few moments, and then says, "You see, the war between the Kaden and Souden is not a real war, for a just cause, or even a lost cause, but a cycle. The impact of the loyalty transfer programs has been that the war is merely a transfer of people from one loyalty to the other, repeatedly, so much that their identity is lost. The war is a collection of toy soldiers marching back and forth across a line, and slowly dying out. You are all fighting yourselves, each other, all on the same side." "But you may still not understand until you know who created the cube, which died in saving you at the base." The tall man pauses for a moment to catch his breath, then speaks very slowly: "You did." *** You have won *** In that game you scored 40 out of a possible 40, in 365 turns, earning you the rank of Liberated.
