[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. You hadn't counted on running into a thief that morning. To be fair, he probably wasn't expecting you either. You were outside minding your own business, working to mend a portion of the fence that surrounds your family's shack, when you spotted a dark figure tearing through the fields.  Startled by the unusual sight, you couldn't help but call out: "HEY!" The thief looked up in your direction, his dusky hood slipping back momentarily, and you were able to make out the curve of an impish smile.  His pace did not slow, however.  As he continued to approach, apparently headed for the dirt path behind you, you noticed a curious bulge at his side.  Something about it just wasn't right. And that's partly why you did what you did. A millisecond before the caped sprinter was upon you, you stuck out your small green foot. [More] As tiny a foot as it was (and is), it did the trick.  The thief went sprawling through the air, sending his bounty bouncing off behind him. He hit the ground with a thud, yelping out a curse in a language you'd never heard before... Trollish, perhaps.  He quickly got to his feet and frantically looked about for the item he'd dropped.  By that time, your father, signaled by the commotion, had already hobbled out with his cane, and your mother was anxiously peering out the window. Realizing his growing audience, the shadowy figure cast one more glance around, uttered one more curse, and then tore off again.  You were still standing there with your mouth gaping open as he disappeared from view.  And the oddest thing... was that the faint sound of laughter in the distance? "Just what is this?!"  Your attention snapped back to the scene at hand.  Your father, with quite a bit of effort, was rolling a large, egg-shaped gem out of a tall patch of grass.  It looked like nothing you'd ever seen before.  It was, in fact, the most beautiful thing you'd ever seen.  The jewel glittered beneath a thin layer of dust, casting prisms of light in every direction. "Can we keep it?" you finally managed, glancing up at your equally enthralled father. He studied the jewel for a moment more, tilting it this way and that. "Aha! Look!" He pointed to one edge.  You could just make out the delicate, silvery script: "PROPERTY OF THE FAIRY PRINCE". [More] "Oh, Mite, we're going to have to return this to him before the whole village gets in a tizzy!" And that's just how this whole journey began. __________________________________________ Mite Copyright (c) 2010 by Sara Dee. Type ABOUT or HINT for more information.
