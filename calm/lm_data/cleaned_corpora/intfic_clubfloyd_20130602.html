"According to the sweep, the interpreter stack may be unstable." "Where is it?" Justy inquires. "Can't tell. It's a global event routine, not embedded in a specific object.

Early VR systems were used in CAD, medical and scientific research, robotics, and the training of pilots, but their most popular use has always been entertainment. The first VRs required users to don large, bulky goggles equipped with tiny monitors for each eye to enter a world of crude polygon graphics. Visual input and output equipment was limited to goggles, gloves and waist sensors. The invention of full-body suits, equipped with millions of tiny sensors, came about in the 1990s, through the use of fiber-optics and holographic imagery. VR hit home computers in the mid-1990s with the advent of VRML, a "markup language" that could be read by various "browsers" or "interpreters". Often these programs were built into headsets and gloves that could be connected to a computer via an adapter card. What is now called the First Generation of VR came to a halt when the viruses began to appear. Today, the Second Generation of VR is nearing birth, with full virtual sensory reality just around the corner. The Corporation is dedicated to protecting the integrity of this new technology through meticulous security measures, in order to avoid the fatal flaws of the First Generation of VR.
