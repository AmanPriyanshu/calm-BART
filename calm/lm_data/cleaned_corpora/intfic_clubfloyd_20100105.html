Maybe if I LOOK around, I can figure out a way to help him out. [ACTION] fathom crimes [STATE] Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now. [ACTION] look

But there's also a sort of nervous energy to him, and his hair's always falling over one eye or the other as he looks around with intense interest. Nate is carrying a BOWLER hat, a CANE, a police BADGE, and a PIECE of paper, and he's wearing a three-piece SUIT. [ACTION] memo
