The central portion is in poor repair, but the right-hand block is comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, show that this is where the family resides. Some scaffolding has been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work has been chipped into, but there are no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit.
