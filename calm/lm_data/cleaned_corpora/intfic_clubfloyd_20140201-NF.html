The display console gives a beep in response as if to acknowledge your success. "Chief here. We're showing activity from the display console in the service conduits. Is that you Zanders? Hold on here...this looks like trouble. Readings from your console show a slow leak from the primary oxygen reserves. Zanders, we've got diagnostics but can't do anything about the leak from here. You'll need to use the console to re-route the oxygen into the forward reserve tank. If you don't, we'll be out of air well before the next deep space transport arrives. We're sending a repair crew to the area, but do what you can." You turn to the now functioning console. The data does confirm a slow leak. This isn't your area of expertise (life support being one of the few systems you don't know inside and out), but you think that initiating the required transfer should be relatively simple. Inserting an override card into one of the console slots should begin moving the oxygen into the forward tank. It would take over 500 zPsi units of oxygen to save the entire station, but since the striking miners are sealed in the rear of the station, you should need far less than that to save the fore section. As for the strikers, they're gonna be outta luck. Their rear oxygen reserve is as empty as the forward reserve that you now depend on... [ACTION] examine diagram

The emergency lighting flickers occasionally, and under the red glow you feel like a spider making your way down a strange red waterspout. Just before you are about to give up and head back to the main conduit, you catch a glimpse of movement down a side conduit. "Hey!" you shout. A large man wearing dark garb turns around. He seems unsteady on his feet, and as he stumbles towards you it is clear why. His face is scorched and peeling and one leg drags feebly on the ground. He mumbles something about not needing assistance, but you help him steady himself and walk him over to the main conduit against his protests. The man is in no position to resist. When you reach the main conduit he tries to say something more, but then he slouches feebly against the wall, exhausted. (press any key to continue) Conduit You crouch uncomfortably in this circular access conduit, just one small segment among thousands that make up the skeleton of Aegis Mining Station. A jefferies tube at the end of the conduit leads down, allowing access to lower levels of the station. The conduit continues to the south. A port access panel is open. A display console is also here, reflecting various measurements. A power cable emerges from the bottom of the console and is attached to the exposed wire in the access panel. The injured man sits against the wall, barely aware of his surroundings. Between static bursts from your radio, the voice of the chief of operations echoes through your conduit. The anger in his voice seems to amplify with each rebounding sound wave until his voice reaches inside your head and stabs at your brain. "Consarnit - Corndog, I know you've got more oxygen flowing to fore than you did a minute ago but you ain't saving enough! More oxygen to the fore section, more to the fore!" The aft override on the display console has changed from "delta" to "none". The injured man stirs, then clutches his leg in pain. [ACTION] examine diagram

You don't hear an explosion, but instead the groaning of the station's metal framework as if about to break apart. The conduit is immersed in darkness for a long moment and then the emergency lighting comes back on, flickering unassuredly. "What the hell was that?" screeches a panicked voice from the radio. You know exactly what that was: the station's stabilization control has lost power, with the result being a temporary malfunction in the gravity control system. Thankfully the backup systems came online. "Fixed itself just in time," you think to yourself just before another gravity shift nearly throws you down the jefferies tube for the second time in one day. You spot the injured man teetering over edge of the precipice and grab hold of his leg (thankfully the one that isn't broken). You are able to pull him away from the jefferies tube.

[STATE]  Time passes. The aft override on the display console has changed from "delta" to "none". [ACTION] wait [STATE]  Time passes. You hear a whoosh as a burst of oxygen is funneled through nearby pipes. The sound of gas rushing through the transfer lines comes to a sudden stop and you hear only the hissing of the steampipe below you. In a moment, the hissing stops as well and you are left in silence. You look down the jefferies tube. There, just a few feet below and resting conveniently on a ledge, is your radio. It must have turned off accidentally when it was thrown around in the gravity shift. You reach down to pick up your radio and turn it back on. "...Chief, now that the oxygen has been re-routed I suggest sealing off the entire A-deck, including the conduit tunnels. We can't take any risks with the rebels." "Agreed. Zanders, get out of there and report to mechanics immediately." The way back to the fore section and mechanics is down the Jefferies tube, which is now clear. You look behind you - the southern tunnel leads to the aft section, and if you wished you could probably use your expertise to sneak into that section before the chief seals off the last remaining route there. Of course the Captain wouldn't be too happy about that. "I guess that's it then," the injured man sighs. "Time for you to go back to your side, and I'll just crawl down the hall back to the rest of us turncoats...I doubt we'll find another route across the station, so we'll be sealed off for good this time." You know for sure he'll never make it down the corridor before the entire deck is sealed off, and he'll likely be sucked out into space. On the other hand, he'll never make it all the way down the jefferies tube with that leg. Two choices surface in your mind. You can leave the injured man in the conduit and save yourself by going down or you can go south, helping him make it to the aft section of the ship. You're pretty sure you can make it down the tube in time, but you're not so sure about the southern tunnel. [ACTION] south
