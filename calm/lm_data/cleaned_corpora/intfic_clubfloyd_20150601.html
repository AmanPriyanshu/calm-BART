[ACTION] hit car [STATE]  (the sleek black car) Yesenia takes a deep, centering breath and then slams her foot into the black car's front bumper. She's reserving her strength; after all, there's no need to punt it across the parking lot, and there would be awkward questions if she did. The car launches an strenuous protest, flashing its lights wildly, shrilling an alarm, and honking its horn - not polite little beeps, but bewildered, angry blares. If Chris is anywhere around, that should get her attention. [ACTION] wait

What the hell are you doing to my car?" "Getting your attention," Yesenia says. "It seems to have worked." (To speak with Chris, TALK TO CHRIS.) [ACTION] hit chris
