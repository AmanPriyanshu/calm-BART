[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] AN ACT OF MURDER An Investigation by Hugh Dunnett Please press SPACE to continue. FOREWORD The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your investigation. The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant: it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead. Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of his arrival. And that's all that's new.  Good luck, Inspector!  Your public awaits! Please press SPACE to continue. "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield. "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from his study window." "Think he might have jumped?" "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder unless you can find anything to prove otherwise." You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says, "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours. The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?" "Got it." What a wonderful way to spend the night. As Chief Inspector Duffy drives off into the darkness, you check your watch to see just how late it really is -- only to find that your watch has stopped.

The woman who appears in the doorway appears to be about 30, quite attractive, with steel-frame glasses. Her manner is cool and aloof; if she is at all disturbed by the current situation, she's hiding it well. She looks you up and down through clear blue eyes before speaking. "Good evening.

He's working on a new stage musical called Twisty Passages, with a friend, Elinor Lamb. They were going to spend the weekend here, working on it together." Just as you pass under the arch into the central hall, the grandfather clock by the stairs chimes the midnight hour in doleful tones. Wonderful. Central Hall The central hall is a two-storeyed room, with wide arches north, northwest, southeast and east. French doors to the south open into the library, and a flight of stairs leads upstairs. The kitchen is through a discreet little door to the west. High above, the night sky is visible through a vast skylight. Deborah Wolf is here, watching you attentively. Loud, ponderous ticking echoes from the grandfather clock by the stairs. The hall telephone stands in its niche beneath the stairs like an inscrutable modern art sculpture. As you set your watch and wind it up, a tall, slender young man emerges from the drawing room to the east. "Ah," he drawls, "the illustrious representative of the Law. How perfectly delightful." He looks down at you with a vaguely supercilious manner. Deborah Wolf makes the introductions. "Inspector, this is Mr Benedict Lamb, Elinor Lamb's brother. As I mentioned, Miss Lamb is collaborating with my husband on a stage musical; and Benedict here is acting chaperone." "Never trust a Wolf alone with a Lamb, I always say." [ACTION] examine deborah

You can't honestly expect him to make that sort of a judgement without evidence!" Benedict merely sneers. Deborah Wolf rolls her eyes and says, "Where is Elinor, Ben?" "She's in the conservatory, of course." Benedict jerks his head to the northwest arch, through which you can see the dining room. "I told her she should go to bed and get some rest, but she insists on staying up for the investigation." He looks in your direction. "Any time you want to speak with her, Inspector, be my guest.

[ACTION] yes [STATE] Deborah lowers her voice and says, "Ben's very protective of his sister, which is sweet but perhaps a little obsessive, in my opinion. Elinor may be wheelchair-bound, but she is nowhere near as delicate as he seems to think." Library The study door to the west is almost obscured by the near-solid screen of crowded bookshelves occupying the west wall. The rest of the room is occupied with modern art. French doors open north to the central hall and southeast onto the terrace. The billiards room is through an anonymous-looking door to the east. Deborah Wolf is here, watching you attentively. On closer inspection, one piece of modern art turns out to actually be a clock. You can also see a tide table here. A short, red-headed young man is bent over a leather briefcase as you enter the Library. He looks up, startled, as you come in, and hurriedly shuts the briefcase. Then he's all smiles and cheerful camaraderie as he tosses his briefcase into a corner and comes forward to shake your hand. "Inspector," says Deborah, "I'd like you to meet Mr Cedric Crane, my uncle's former accountant. He was the one -- along with Mr Lamb -- who discovered the crime and raised the alarm." Cedric Crane pumps your arm with all the excessive energy of a campaigning politician. Close up, you realise that he must actually be quite a bit older than he appeared at first glance. "A pleasure to make your acquaintance," he says expansively, beaming from ear to ear. [ACTION] get briefcase

Cedric smiles, but it doesn't quite reach his eyes. The door to the east suddenly crashes open, revealing a broad-shouldered, truculent-looking man holding a billiard cue. He glares at you. "This is Alexander Wolf," says Deborah, "my husband." Alexander makes a brief sweeping gesture by way of greeting, and growls, "let's get this over with as quickly as possible, eh?" "Alex, you've been drinking." Cedric Crane whispers to you, "We'd best head on out, Inspector." He quietly exits the room to the southeast. [ACTION] southeast

Cedric Crane nods to you. "Right then. You've met the Wolfs, of course; have you met the Lambs? Benedict and Elinor? The five of us would be the only people in the house at the moment, other than yourself.

Treacherous-looking rocks surround the beach, but a narrow path back up to the house has been cut into the cliff face behind you, and the rocks to the northwest look just safe enough to clamber over. You can see Cedric Crane here. Cedric Crane looks around at you and points off to the northwest. "There's a small tide pool out that way. That's where Mr Lamb and I found the body. I think it must have been a bit after 11:00 pm -- probably about 11:10 pm -- we're not surrounded by clocks out here as we are up in the house.

On one side, the cliff rises sharply up, and from here you can just make out the broken window of Frederic Sheppard's study.

FOREWORD The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your investigation. The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant: it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead. Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of his arrival. And that's all that's new.  Good luck, Inspector!  Your public awaits! Please press SPACE to continue. "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield. "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from his study window." "Think he might have jumped?" "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder unless you can find anything to prove otherwise." You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says, "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours. The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?" "Got it." What a wonderful way to spend the night.
