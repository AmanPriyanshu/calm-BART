"Wait..." I thought. Perhaps he got too carried away, as he didnt stop in the corridor and entered the room in an unstoppable rush which lead him directly to the trapdoor hole... "Yiaaaahhh...!! CRASH!! "Ouch... That must have hurt!!" I thought, and looked into the hole to see Doc's shiny vision lying on the floor below... in time to see Rose's fuzzy image running towards him... "It's okay, it's okay" he said "It's been just some scrapes... You're not to worr..." But she wouldn't let him finish. Giving away a side of herself I would never wanted to see, she embraced him tenderly until they both merged in a long, passionate kiss. And I knew then, beeing the unsuspected witness of their privacy, that as certain as there was a real world outside of the house, any wish, any hope I had concerning Rose would never, ever, fit in it. Their images vanished again as I realized they were stuck downstairs, and if there were an exit to the house it was on my side, so it was up to me to find it and eventually come back to their rescue.

Homecoming Night allows over 130 word associations, grouped into 8 categories. Loving Sam allows over 400 word associations, grouped into 21 categories.
