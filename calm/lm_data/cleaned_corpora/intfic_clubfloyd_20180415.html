[ACTION] east [STATE] As I step through the door, something hits me like a flying locomotive.  Next thing I know, my back is pressed against the wall, there's someone holding me on either side, and Mr.  Biggs is staring me in the face, his eyes bulging out like he was going to explode. "So, I'll bet you think you're very clever, don't you?"  he wheezes. "Yes, very, very clever, huh?  Well I'll show you who's clever.  I'm going to tie you up, and throw you into a vat of boiling water.  I'm going to cut open your stomach, and pull out all your intestines, and fry them up while you watch me do it!  I'm going to make you scream so loud you'll wish you'd never been born! You're going to beg me to let you die, and I'm going to stand there and smile at you!  I'm going to make you..." Suddenly he stops.  A peaceful look comes over his face, and he almost looks like he's smiling.  "No.  I have an even better idea.  I'll let the owners deal with you themselves.  I'm sure they can find an appropriate...use...for you."  This time he really does smile, and something about it sends a chill through my whole body. He spins around without another look and starts walking away.  "Let's go.  Bring him along!"  I'm half dragged, half carried through a series of doorways, down a hall I've never seen before, through another set of doors.  Suddenly I find myself staring at a final doorway.  It's open, and there are stairs leading down into darkness. A coldness, and a strange musty smell, rises out of it. "OK," says Mr.  Biggs.  "Throw him in."  There's a shove, the hands holding me let go, and I find myself tumbling down the stairs. Something cracks against my head on the way down, and I hit the bottom with a painful thump.  The sound of the door slamming shut echoes through the darkness like the fall of a headsman's ax. It's pitch black. [ACTION] turn on flashlight

No boxes or furniture anymore, just a huge pile of...  stuff...  in the middle of the floor.  It's a mass of all sorts of odds and ends:  scraps of cloth, old phone books, broken mattresses, and who knows what else. It looks like a giant rat's nest.  The strange musty smell that fills the basement is stronger here, like it was coming from this pile. [ACTION] examine nest
[STATE] Basement This is the oddest room.  Well, the room itself is ordinary enough - more concrete, more pipes, doorways leading east and north.  It looks like this was once a storeroom.  I can see discolored patches on the walls and floor where large boxes must have sat for a long time. It's the current contents of the room that are strange.

[STATE] Please, don't make me go any closer.  I don't like this place.  I don't know what it is, but I want to leave.  Please... [ACTION] north [STATE] Basement I'm in what must be the basement of the factory.  The walls and floor are made of concrete, and the ceiling is covered with pipes and ventilation ducts.  Large metal light fixtures hang down at regular intervals.  There is a thick layer of dust on the floor.  Otherwise, the room is completely empty. Open doorways lead south and east.  A metal staircase attached to the north wall leads upward. [ACTION] east

The room is almost completely empty, except for one thing:  sitting right in the center of the concrete floor is a little table, the sort of fancy table made from curved pieces of wood that you find in antique stores. And on top of the table is a telephone. [ACTION] examine table

The feet are shaped like claws holding balls, and the legs are carved to look like they're covered with flowers.  I have no idea what this thing is doing here.  I can hardly imagine anywhere that it would look more out of place.  I don't understand anything that's going on. [ACTION] east

Or rather, it would be closed if there weren't a huge hole smashed right through the middle.  It looks like a freight train went through here, and the door got in the way. [ACTION] up

[ACTION] up [STATE] I climb through the hole in the door to the hallway on the other side. It takes a few wrong turns, but eventually I find my way back upstairs again.  The whole factory seems to be deserted.  Not a sign of anyone. The parking lot is completely empty. As I stand waiting at the bus stop, I have the strangest feeling. It's like waking up from a trance, or leaving the auditorium at the end of a concert.  I know I've been somewhere strange, witnessed amazing things, but I'm not certain exactly what they were.  "States of dreamy melancholy, fits of aimless joy."  Was I the audience or the performer?  Did it really happen, or was it just a fantasy?  A witch's spell?  Am I the artist?  And if not, then who is? I think I'll stop off at the mall on my way home.  I need an ice cream cone. Dear Mom, Thanks a lot for the cookies you sent.  They were really great.  I still say you make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. My new job is going really well.  I never would have guessed that screwing caps onto toothpaste tubes could be so interesting.  My boss, Mr. Bucket, says I have a natural talent for it. I was really lucky to find a job so quickly.  A lot of the guys from Frobworks are still looking.  No one's sure what the new owners are planning to do with the building yet, but there's a rumor that they want to start a computer game company. Pretty weird, huh? Anyway, thanks a lot.  I'll write again soon.  I love you a lot. Your son, Peter P.S. Next time, could you send chocolate chip instead? This game is a work of interactive fiction.
