The wide-spread plague seems to be focused on the area of language itself. In some cases, what were once simple actions to perform now require the use of old, time-worn phrases. In other cases, objects and even citizens have been transformed overnight into strange mutations of their previous selves. A man-on-the-street interview conducted by this reporter proved fruitless. Two local farmers asked for their opinions of the situation said they couldn't make head or tail of it, and made no further statement. The mayor of Punster, whose administration has been widely viewed as being paralyzed and corrupted by the plague, could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, a Citizens' Action Committee was recently formed to probe for ways to restore the town of Punster to its happily mundane condition.

[STATE] This a grotesque, clownish, Punchinello mask, apparently worn by the mayor when he travels incognito. [ACTION] throw baby out with bathwater [STATE] From the consequential uproar, there seems to be a ring of truth in this phrase. In strong jets shooting at varying trajectories, the bathwater in the tub begins first to spout off. Suddenly, this messy but harmless spectacle of the spouts is over, and angry riptides ruffle the water's surface. Now with the tidal force of lunar determination, the bathwater polarizes itself around the edges of the tub and even higher, engulfing the mayor and leaving a wide funnel of air in the middle of the tub. As the gathering water reaches a critical peak, it pauses for one brief moment, and now with an awful suddenness collapses into itself to form a fearful wave of tubular shape and seismic strength. It gushes in front of your face and toward the stairs in a torrent, through which you can see the strange slow-motion figure of the mayor swimming half in air and half in water. Following the mayor inside the wave and down the stairway is the tub itself, which, out of your sight, makes the terrible crashing noise of porcelain going to smithereens. [ACTION] pull the plug on bath
