The slat is thrown open, and the man in white seems to hiccup before shouting something, that you can only suppose is the word JAMON! At this, the door is thrown open and the strange man holds his hat on as windy golden light blows out the door, surrounding him in a smoky halo.  And you've only had one drink today, seriously. As quickly as it started, the windy light stops and the man proceeds into the StepEasy, the door slamming securely shut behind him. "He's so dreamy!" intones young Betsy, swooning.

The warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the northeast. A hush falls over the crowd as they all catch sight of the thin man in a spotlight.  He pulls a large coin out of his pocket and flicks it in the air, declaring "HOO!"

The thin man shrieks "EEHEE!" and the coin resumes its path straight into the slot of the jukebox.New-fangled, almost unearthly music with a heavy, unrelenting beat begins as the needle drops on the record. The oddly-thin man in white stands disinterestedly.  His hands move furitively over the brim of his white hat and his belt as if repositioning them with bird-like speed.

Corner of Warehouse The entire warehouse is cleared of its normal furnishings except for some support beams, and indigo light arcs in from high semicircular barred windows.  The entire place is packed with StepEasy denizens, all spastically writhing to the bits of discordant music played by the band, dancing and yet pretending not to dance by writhing, remaining away from the legal limits of the choreography laws.  It looks like you could move through the crowd west and northwest.  The north part of the dancefloor from here is really packed and it would probably take a molotov cocktail to get in amongst the throng.

As you are making your way through, you hear a guttural shout from below--the lights change, and all the dancers move in slow motion.  They writhe in a tight knot around the Thin Man, exclaiming random words and syllables and sounds in either wracking pain, desperation, or delirious ecstacy as the downside of Muse Terpsichore takes them out of their heads. Such are the results of a continuous life of dance-crime, you reckon sadly to yourself. Warehouse Rooftop You're on top of the warehouse where it has stopped raining, but a cool breeze ripples the puddles of rain that have accumulated.  To your left, (the west that is) is the entrance to a shabby rooftop flat.  To the north there is barely a step up onto the wide, low wall that surrounds the edge of the building.  Between that and the gravel rooftop of the other building to the north is a sickening, likely fatal, plunge. You can see some flying bullets, a Chartreuse Thug, a Green Thug, a Blue Thug and a Red Thug here. You have to duck into the apartment to avoid getting filled with hot lead.  You hurl yourself back inside as shrapnel clatters into the apartment wall. Her Apartment A standard tiny two-room flat, much tidier on the inside than out.

You are forced into some gymnastic positions and movements just to keep your feet on the floor.  You could climb up a metal fire escape staircase that leads to the second floor walkway.  The warehouse exit is south, the band platform is southwest, and the less-crowded section of dancefloor is east. > E You can't go that way. > SW Band Platform A combo band and a microphone is set up in the opposite corner from the warehouse entrance.  From here, you notice that there is a second floor walkway that would seem to lead to an upstairs apartment, but the fire-escape-like stairs are right in the middle of that violent throng of dancers in the northeast corner of the building.  The warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the northeast. The oddly-thin man in white stands aloofly.  His hands move furitively over the brim of his white hat and his belt as if repositioning them with bird-like speed. A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here against the wall. The Thin Man tosses another coin in the air, then shouts hoo at it, making it hover.  Then he says eehee a little louder, and the coin goes flying directly into the slot of the jukebox. > X MAN (thin man) He's tall and thin, wearing a glowing white suit and matching black-banded fedora that shadows his eyes.  His body is always seeming both frozen in an angular position and in constant motion with part of his physique still and the rest moving subtly. The dancers PIROUETTE, pull their KNEES IN and they NOD NOD. > X SUIT (the dark gray suit) It's dark gray, so as to be inconspicuous without being so dark as to cause panic in people you interact with.  It's also a size or two larger than you need, in case you need to become a man of action at any given moment. The dancers HEELPIVOT, POINTPOINT and HEADPOP. > X WHITE SUIT It's spotless, despite him being in the rain without a coat. The dancers simultaneously JUMPSHRUG, SHOULDERROLL, and HEADPOP, then they turn to the southwest, while crossing the floor NORTHEAST, penetrating the crowded right dance floor where everyone makes room for them. > X JUKEBOX You can see records trundling inside, but all the selector keys have been broken off, so it looks like you get pot-luck for putting your coin in the slot.  The plastic dome has a few dents, almost as if it has sustained several good hard thumps in its lifetime. The dancers LEAN over, hovering at an unnatural angle with their feet still on the floor, seemingly defying gravity.  The crowd goes wild, and everyone on the dancefloor joins in, somehow knowing what move comes next at rapid-fire high speed. [ACTION] get jukebox
[STATE]  Warehouse Rooftop You're on top of the warehouse where it has stopped raining, but a cool breeze ripples the puddles of rain that have accumulated.  To your left, (the west that is) is the entrance to a shabby rooftop flat.  To the north there is barely a step up onto the wide, low wall that surrounds the edge of the building.  Between that and the gravel rooftop of the other building to the north is a sickening, likely fatal, plunge. You can see an alien ant farm, a Chartreuse Thug, a Green Thug, a Blue Thug and a Red Thug here. The Red Thug works to reload his gun. The Blue Thug sprays a rattle of machine-gun fire across the rooftop. In your adrenaline rush, the bullets seem to slow down as they approach. The Green Thug works to reload his gun. The Chartreuse Thug sprays a rattle of machine-gun fire across the rooftop.

All the dancers JUMPSHRUG and bring their KNEES IN, and they NOD NOD, and they HEELPIVOT, POINT POINT.  Then they all do a HEADPOP, and they JUMPSHRUG, and they SHOULDERROLL, KNEES IN.  Everyone does a HEELPIVOT, POINT POINT and finally STEPSLIDE out of it. Solo dances continue excitedly as the formation breaks up. > L Band Platform A combo band and a microphone is set up in the opposite corner from the warehouse entrance.  From here, you notice that there is a second floor walkway that would seem to lead to an upstairs apartment, but the fire-escape-like stairs are right in the middle of that violent throng of dancers in the northeast corner of the building.  The warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the northeast. The oddly-thin man in white stands disinterestedly.  He points a finger up into the sky while looking away from it in the opposite direction for seemingly no reason. A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here against the wall. Everyone pelvic thrusts suggestively around you, and the crowd goes insane. The Thin Man shouts whoa as he balances on his toes for a surprisingly long time, almost as if gravity has no effect. > TAKE GLOVE That seems to belong to thin man. > TAKE FEDORA (your fedora) You already got it. > N Left Dancefloor Spotlights operated by mysterious figures overhead pick out the most risque dancers on this parquet square of premium dance space that continues to the east.  The band is south, and the warehouse exit is southeast.  The even better dancers pack the floor to the east, and you're unsure if you could get through there to where that staircase leading up is. You notice a dim passage also to the west. > W Dim Passage This dim, slickly light green-painted corridor leads south and east back to the dancefloor.  There is some lettering stencilled on the wall. A large man wearing thick glasses and sitting on what must be the worlds most tiny, uncomfortable stool glares dimly at you with his arms folded. > S The bouncer says "Wisten bub.  I'm watching that office, and I see you headed in that diwection.  Just beat it, beat it hoo." > MOONWALK What do you want to moonwalk? > MOONWALK SOUTH You should try moonwalking the opposite of the direction you intend to travel. > MOONWALK NORTH You shiftily transfer your weight and push with your toes so that it appears you are walking north while moving south. You afford the dim bouncer a friendly nod as you scrape your way backward, southward...into the office while facing north the entire time. Back Office This makeshift office appears to be where the club payroll and work schedule are figured.  The only exit is north. A blue beam of light shines down on the desk. You can also see a bulletin board here. > X LIGHT In the blue beam of light is a different marker. > TAKE MARKER (the different marker) You take the different marker into evidence even though you don't have any little baggies. Your feet suddenly leave the ground as the dim bouncer picks you up by the neck and squeezes.  "Wissen pow," he growls.  "I told you to beat it!  And despite my extweme neawsightedness, I can see the mawker is gone.  So now I'm gonna beat you!"  Which he then proceeds to do, in grand and professional fashion. Corner of Warehouse The entire warehouse is cleared of its normal furnishings except for some support beams, and indigo light arcs in from high semicircular barred windows.  The entire place is packed with StepEasy denizens, all spastically writhing to the bits of discordant music played by the band, dancing and yet pretending not to dance by writhing, remaining away from the legal limits of the choreography laws.  It looks like you could move through the crowd west and northwest.  The north part of the dancefloor from here is really packed and it would probably take a molotov cocktail to get in amongst the throng. A narrow window in the corner seems to be where clubgoers can check their coats. > UNDO Back Office [Previous turn undone.] > PUT MARKER IN LIGHT (your marker in the blue beam of light) You put your marker into the blue beam of light. > TAKE DIFFERENT You take the different marker into evidence even though you don't have any little baggies. > N Dim Passage This dim, slickly light green-painted corridor leads south and east back to the dancefloor.  There is some lettering stencilled on the wall. A large man wearing thick glasses and sitting on what must be the worlds most tiny, uncomfortable stool glares dimly at you with his arms folded. > E "Enjoy your evening in the cwub!" exclaims the dim bouncer, waving. Left Dancefloor Spotlights operated by mysterious figures overhead pick out the most risque dancers on this parquet square of premium dance space that continues to the east.  The band is south, and the warehouse exit is southeast.  The even better dancers pack the floor to the east, and you're unsure if you could get through there to where that staircase leading up is.
