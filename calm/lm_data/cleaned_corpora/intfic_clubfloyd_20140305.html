Many, perhaps, would call it spying instead," she says darkly. > FIRES "The moon has waxed and grown small again since they arrived," Sihan murmurs, holding you tightly. "Why don't they come to us? Why do they hide when we send our emissaries? They must know the unrest they're causing in us." > NIGHT Sihan points up at the night sky. "See how bright the stars are," she says, "as if the gods themselves gather round our fire to hear the teller's story." > TELLING "It is almost time," your love says seriously. "I wonder, what story will we hear tonight? The people are buzzing about the newcomers; perhaps the teller's story will be about them." > X TENTS Your people do not stay in one place from birth to death like the people of the city, nor are you always wandering, like the people of the desert; you find a peaceful spot and stay there till the animals move on or the stream dries up. These are their homes; they are all you need. Sihan glances towards the fire pit and takes her medicine bag from you, slinging it into its familiar place around her neck. "Let us join the gathering and hear the story," your love says lightly, and turns to the FIRE at the center of the village. > FIRE You walk to the firepit with Sihan, and friends and neighbors greet you with a nod or quiet word. Always the fire pit is the center of the village, and always the people gather there. Faint smells of tonight's great feast still linger, but the fire now smolders low, only a shadow of its roaring fierceness at sunset. Nabu and Isi stand near the fire, along with a growing crowd. Sihan stands near your side. > GREET CROWD A genuine smile fills your face as you greet some friends. There is little news other than that of the newcomers, but it is good to see their faces, nonetheless. > GREET ISI "My brightest light," says Isi as she always does, a smile lighting her face as she pulls you down to kiss your cheek. > GREET NABU Your uncle Nabu regards you seriously. "Are you ready to fight for your people, should you be called upon?" he asks. "Perhaps it will not come to fighting," you say. "Who can tell?" he says, "But those who bear arms must be prepared, nonetheless." Sihan places a hand on your shoulder. "Go on, my love," she says softly. "Give the circlet of office to the STORYTELLER. It is time." > STORYTELLER "The storyteller awaits," Sihan says. "The telling cannot begin until the teller's circlet has been gifted." > X CIRCLET Sihan spent countless weeks collecting the delicate feathers and weaving them together to make this circlet. It is light as air in your hands, and seems to glow in the firelight. > GIVE CIRCLET TO ISI You approach your aunt Isi and hand the circlet to the white-haired old woman. She takes it delicately, eyeing the craftsmanship, and then turns to Sihan with a nod and a warm smile. Carefully, she lifts it up to her old head--and now before you is no longer your father's sister, but the storyteller... a role she has taken every new moon for many years. > TALK TO NABU "How is your knee?" you ask your uncle gently. He rubs it with a rueful smile. "It aches tonight," he says, looking to the stars. "Rain is coming, despite appearances. A heavy rain." Saiph approaches the far side of the fire and greets some friends warmly. > MOCK SAIPH "Will you and your cronies hear tonight's story, Saiph?" you call across the fire. "Or will you be too busy weaving flower garlands for the newcomer attack force?" Saiph stares at you with dagger eyes. "Your taunts only reveal your immaturity," he says. "Do not trouble me with more of them." Sihan kisses your cheek. "May the story bring you what you seek," she whispers, then slips into the crowd. Your beloved has always liked to hear the stories by herself. > MOCK SAIPH He is not nearby. > TALK TO ISI He is not nearby. > LISTEN A log falls in the fire, sending a shower of sparks up into the night. The murmurings of the people die away as the storyteller rises to her feet and raises two bony hands. > X STORYTELLER She is not nearby. > LISTEN It is strangely quiet around the fire. The storyteller shouts, "In this time of darkness the people gather for the telling. Will the people hear?" > YES You call out your response along with many others. The crowd cries out with one voice, "The people are ready." The teller bows humbly, accepting the people's blessing, then straightens with the hint of a smile. "Tonight," she says, "we shall hear an old, old story, from days long ago when great cities and mighty kings ruled this land. May you find in the story that which you seek." > PRAISE STORYTELLER She is not nearby. > LISTEN A bat circles above the fire for a moment, then swoops away. The storyteller lifts her hands in invocation. "Our story begins," she says quietly, "in the far-off city of URUK. Uruk of the broad streets, Uruk of the mighty WALLS. Can you see them, gleaming in the desert heat?" The teller gestures into the night, and in your mind the walls come alive, shimmering in the desert air. "Come," she continues, "cross the ancient threshold, walk the streets and orchards and markets. Walk the streets and climb the great stone steps to the TEMPLE. Climb the steps and find the box of burnished copper. Find the box and undo the lock and draw out the great TABLET of deep blue stone. Draw out the tablet and read of Uruk's king, Uruk's pride, Uruk's greatest hero. Hear of the trials of GILGAMESH." > WALL "How high were the walls of Uruk?" you ask. "As high as ten men," the storyteller replies, "and made of the finest brickwork both inside and outside. GILGAMESH built them, a work no later king could match, to defend the people of URUK from her foes. From their top the whole city is laid out below you, only the TEMPLE still above." Saiph glowers at you from across the flames. > X SAIPH He is not nearby. > TABLET "From where came this tablet of bluest stone?" you ask. "GILGAMESH carved it," the teller says, "cut his words deep into the tablet of lapis lazuli, bluest of blues. Wise Gilgamesh carved all his exploits and knowledge into the tablets, and hid them under the cornerstone of URUK, so men would remember his deeds long after he went to the underworld.

"ENKIDU heard how Gilgamesh took the young men from their fathers and the young women from their mothers, and he grew angry," says the storyteller. "Enkidu grew angry and came to the city of Uruk, when he had never before entered a city of man. Enkidu entered the city and sought out Gilgamesh, and they fought. Walls shook; people cowered; the cobblestones cracked as they wrestled through the streets. Gilgamesh was the victor, but so awed was he by Enkidu's strength that he lifted him to his feet and made a bond of friendship that would never break."
