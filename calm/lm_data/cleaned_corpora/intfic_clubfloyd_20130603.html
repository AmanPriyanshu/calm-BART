The river is very wide; the shores are rocky and desolate, with only a few short, leafless, twisted plants growing along the riverbank.  The sky is densely clouded, but not dark; the clouds reflect the red glow that seems to come from the horizon in all directions.  It strikes you that it is exceedingly quiet; you hear no noise from the boat's engines, and even the boat's rapid slicing through the still waters seems to make no sound.  It is so quiet that you hear only your own breathing -- you realize that it's surprising that you're breathing at all, given that you're dead.  A stairway leads down, and a doorway leads east.

The experiment we're performing is in a field called Micro-Economics, which means that we're going to attempt to model a particular set of market forces under controlled conditions. As a result, you may find the experiment to be quite abstract, but don't worry; we don't actually want you to understand the point of this experiment, for two reasons.  First, if you knew what we were attempting to prove, it would bias the results.  And second, our theories might seem strange, or even laughable, to the layman, and you might be left with the impression that Economics is something less -- much less -- than the precise and exacting science that we Economists know it to be. But you will be able to rest assured in your confusion that the economic future of Hell is in capable hands.  You can tell by our white labcoats, clipboards, and seemingly effortless use of large words that we are authority figures to be respected -- yes -- and feared! "Now, the rules of the experiment are quite simple.  Each of you is a trader in goods we will call 'widgets.'  The experiment will consist of a series of trading rounds.  In each trading round, you will conduct a transaction with the subject to your left and the one to your right. "We will be using what we Economists refer to as the Extended RSP Trading Model, which stands for Rock, Scissors, Paper.  We call it 'extended' because we have added a new element that radically changes the equation:  dynamite.  In this model, dynamite pulverizes rock, rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper -- yes, to shreds!  -- but paper covers dynamite. "You start with 5 widgets.  In each trading round, you will choose dynamite, rock, scissors, or paper, and your trading choice will be compared with the choices of those to your left and right.  The subject who prevails out of each group of three will acquire one widget each from the subjects on the left and right.  The experiment will proceed for five trading rounds. "As an incentive to do your best, if you manage to win every round, you will be awarded Twenty Hellmids at the end of the experiment. Choose carefully."

He stands facing away from the cubicles, and runs his hands through his hair, inhaling deeply.  He then abruptly turns on his heel to face the cubicles.  He has short, curly black hair, and is wearing very thick, dark glasses, a white lab coat, and black leather gloves. "Thank you all for coming.

[STATE] Downtown [ACTION] west [STATE] Suburbs You're on a quiet, pleasant suburban street to the west of the city. Somehow, you always knew there would be suburbs in hell.  The street is lined with the type of tract housing they built copiously in California in the 1950's:  one-story buildings with flat roofs, horizontal lines, lots of windows, and poor construction quality.  A drab, faded blue-green house lies to the south, and a mini-mall lies to the north. The street leads east back into the city.  To the west, the street fades to a gravel path. A man whose clothes are on fire is running around in circles, flailing his arms and screaming.  He runs off to the east. [ACTION] east

He then abruptly turns on his heel to face the cubicles.  He has short, curly black hair, and is wearing very thick, dark glasses, a white lab coat, and black leather gloves. "Thank you all for coming.  I'm Doctor Merkwurtigblatt, and I'll be your scientist today.  The experiment we're performing is in a field called Micro-Economics, which means that we're going to attempt to model a particular set of market forces under controlled conditions. As a result, you may find the experiment to be quite abstract, but don't worry; we don't actually want you to understand the point of this experiment, for two reasons.  First, if you knew what we were attempting to prove, it would bias the results.  And second, our theories might seem strange, or even laughable, to the layman, and you might be left with the impression that Economics is something less -- much less -- than the precise and exacting science that we Economists know it to be. But you will be able to rest assured in your confusion that the economic future of Hell is in capable hands.  You can tell by our white labcoats, clipboards, and seemingly effortless use of large words that we are authority figures to be respected -- yes -- and feared! "Now, the rules of the experiment are quite simple.  Each of you is a trader in goods we will call 'widgets.'  The experiment will consist of a series of trading rounds.  In each trading round, you will conduct a transaction with the subject to your left and the one to your right. "We will be using what we Economists refer to as the Extended RSP Trading Model, which stands for Rock, Scissors, Paper.  We call it 'extended' because we have added a new element that radically changes the equation:  dynamite.  In this model, dynamite pulverizes rock, rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper -- yes, to shreds!  -- but paper covers dynamite. "You start with 5 widgets.  In each trading round, you will choose dynamite, rock, scissors, or paper, and your trading choice will be compared with the choices of those to your left and right.  The subject who prevails out of each group of three will acquire one widget each from the subjects on the left and right.  The experiment will proceed for five trading rounds. "As an incentive to do your best, if you manage to win every round, you will be awarded Twenty Hellmids at the end of the experiment. Choose carefully."
