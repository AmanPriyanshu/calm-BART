Symbols and colors fill your vision, all incomprehensible.  Then everything goes dark for a moment. Welcome to Scout 3LZ, a representative of the glorious V'lvxnlxian empire! Scout 3LZ is one of the newer, faster Cuppa model scout ships.  It incorporates new technology from the Waveparticle Duality Consortium. As a result, Cuppa model scouts boast an extremely short transit time between solar systems and high atmospheric maneuverability. Scout 3LZ carries a crew of two: Zigurt and Floban.  Both are native V'lvxnlxians, and both have had long and illustrious careers with the Corps.  They are currently enjoying their tour through one of the lesser-explored arms of the galaxy, though they hope to find potential colony sites soon. What kind of colony sites does the Corps look for?  Corps personnel are experienced planetologists who have an eye for comfort.  They report on only the best planets, ones which are within 98% of V'lvxnlxia norms. Though many different biospheres are acceptable, planets with dry climates and dim suns are a must. Corps personnel are also skilled negotiators and diplomats, in case a potential colony planet possesses a native race.  A certain amount of intelligence is welcome in natives, as smarter natives are more capable of following orders.  However, should a native population be found to possess intelligence above a 5.9 on the L'xlvnxl scale, the planet may require a quick bio-scrubbing. For your convenience while on-board, a temporary overlay map of the ship will be downloaded and installed.  For visitors who are unable to handle a fully interactive overlay map, a hardcopy will be created for them. When you can see normally again, you find that you now possess a map of the ship.

Floban follows him, waving his tentacles about madly. "What did I tell you?  The light out here has become unbearable.  How do you expect me to concentrate on our plans with the sound of so many photons bombarding our ship's repulso-field?" "Your point is taken," Zigurt replies thoughtfully.  He brings out a large ray gun, complete with flanges and doohickeys.  He braces its barrel against one tentacle and fires at the lights.  With a FZOOM! a shower of sparks falls from a nearby tree.

Zigurt is drawing a bead on the lights once more when something hits one of them and breaks it with a quiet tinkle.  In the reduced glare, both you and Zigurt turn to look at Floban, who has dropped a tentaclefull of medium-sized rocks.
