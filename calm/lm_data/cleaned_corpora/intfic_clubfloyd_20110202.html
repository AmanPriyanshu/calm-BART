Several people were going over these files. The files talk about a John Doe victim who was bitten in the leg, punctured a major vessel, lost consciousness, and whose heart had stopped for 2 minutes.  The heart resumed function, and then the man jumped out of his stretcher and attacked several doctors with his teeth.  He had to be restrained, but not after biting several orderlies and other staff. Whenever he noticed anyone in the vicinity, he would mindlessly and completely devote himself to attacking and eating that person.  There is a note about his disease definitely being transmitted by bite - you guess this means the staff turned as well, but you suppose their records would be kept confidentially separate from this John Doe.  You suppose that they somehow passed the disease on themselves.

He relaxes slightly and sits still as you jam the key into the padlock and hear the comforting click.  He rips off his gag and throws the duct tape away, gasping in pain.  He immediately slumps into a relieved mass and whispers out a "thank you." He then stares up at you with the sweetest, heart-warming smile.  You blush and for the first time realize what a handsome man he is.  You return the smile. Well, all that's left to do really is stay here and wait for the calvary. [ACTION] drop gun
