[ACTION] read review [STATE]  You touch the S.hip of Theseus review. S.hip of Theseus I was so pleased to see VM Straka's Ship of Theseus adapted as a game; he's a criminally underrated writer. S.hip of Theseus is one of the most interesting experiments I've seen since the House of Leaves ARG disaster, so naturally I was excited to see what the developers did. The manner of adaptation feels like an homage to its source material: the game blends traditional IF tools with new technology as you piece together the multinational conspiracy at its heart. Most notably, the game tracks your progress via drone surveillance, which is used to trigger later levels and make information assimilation more difficult. (Flooding my department was a nice touch of verisimilitude for which I applaud the anonymous designer.) Where S.hip of Theseus shines is the incorporation of multiplayer format; in Act 2 you're paired with another player, and so the narrative shifts. Clues are possible to destroy, depending on how careful a reader you are - or your partner is. (There's been a lot of complaining about the procedurally-generated pairing lists, but the developers quite rightly pointed out that it's possible to rig a simple last-in-first-out stack to ensure two friends or lovers are paired together. Though I can't imagine why you'd want to - being responsible for a loved one's implication in a major government for a good 5-7 years if they can forgive you.)

It didn't take you too long after joining the S.hip of Theseus team to learn why being cast such a large number for "charm" on a throw of the cosmic dice would be so important. > X COMPUTER Every titan on the S.hip team monitors their own distinct set of players. Outfitted with microphone and webcam, and with a touch-screen, the computer is everything a titan needs. Using the HarborMaster software, a titan can fix bugs in real-time, monitor players through both transcripts and game sessions, and initiate real-world responses, which include directing drones and communicating with field agents. Thunderbird, your e-mail program, is open, and the "Rebuilding the Ship" message has been flagged. > READ MESSAGE You touch the flagged e-mail. The e-mail is from Kathryn Bogelew, one of the Marketing executives at FromChaos: Below is an article that will be published by The First POV on Monday. Please notify me if it contains contentious material. Thank you. Will the Ship Sink? Two years ago, an anonymous game creator released S.hip of Theseus, a game that redefined "interactive." The game took place on screen and in the "real world." The within-game conspiracies spilled over into reality, and players could find their inboxes full of incriminating e-mails, their movements followed by cameras, their conversations recorded. Players had reason to be suspicious of that stranger hanging around the street or the people they saw at the grocery store. The game became a huge success and eventually an independent game creator, Marc Kamen, was outed as its author. Industry came calling, but Marc refused their advances. Unfortunately, and apparently without warning to family or friends, Marc committed suicide. FromChaos obtained the rights to his creation. With their deeper pockets and vast resources, FromChaos turned S.hip of Theseus into a worldwide blockbuster. A sequel was inevitable. Earlier this year, FromChaos released Gaia's Web, which wasn't that sequel, but rather a purely text-based introduction to what was to come. This Friday, FromChaos is publishing the heavily-anticipated follow-up to S.hip, Re.constructing the Ship of Theseus. Every day this week we will be previewing this new release, which boasts that it is "interactive fiction that will change your world. Literally." For more information on S.hip of Theseus, read my review of the game. Kathryn has attached the review, even though you can just click on the link in her e-mail. > READ REVIEW You touch the S.hip of Theseus review. S.hip of Theseus I was so pleased to see VM Straka's Ship of Theseus adapted as a game; he's a criminally underrated writer. S.hip of Theseus is one of the most interesting experiments I've seen since the House of Leaves ARG disaster, so naturally I was excited to see what the developers did. The manner of adaptation feels like an homage to its source material: the game blends traditional IF tools with new technology as you piece together the multinational conspiracy at its heart. Most notably, the game tracks your progress via drone surveillance, which is used to trigger later levels and make information assimilation more difficult. (Flooding my department was a nice touch of verisimilitude for which I applaud the anonymous designer.) Where S.hip of Theseus shines is the incorporation of multiplayer format; in Act 2 you're paired with another player, and so the narrative shifts. Clues are possible to destroy, depending on how careful a reader you are - or your partner is. (There's been a lot of complaining about the procedurally-generated pairing lists, but the developers quite rightly pointed out that it's possible to rig a simple last-in-first-out stack to ensure two friends or lovers are paired together. Though I can't imagine why you'd want to - being responsible for a loved one's implication in a major government for a good 5-7 years if they can forgive you.) A siren calls from your computer; HarborMaster hails. > LOOK Six months on the job, and your office still seems unreal: big-screen television, stereo system, soundproofed walls, and a cover for the window to minimize exterior sound and light. Outside the window and anchored to the building is a drone launch pad. The most important piece of equipment, though, remains the desktop computer. HarborMaster continues its siren call. > X HARBORMASTER HarborMaster loads with the message: Good afternoon. We have updated our systems, and we need a new password for you.
