Inside it the six icons whirl. As the Cave forms around you, the glowing moth flutters up into its high, dark recesses. Its light shines softly on gleaming limestone. And on the bats. One flutters by and nips the moth right out of the air. Whoops. The moth shimmers, desperately seeking another form, one less vulnerable. It breaks up into pixels -- and reforms as a fat snowflake, drifting around the upper regions of the Cave. The bats, apparently uninterested in bits of ice, now ignore it. [ACTION] press heat

At the south end the hall rises, and an enormous wooden chest stands on an earthen mound. The chest is open and empty. The cube that is your workspace rests nearby. Inside it the six icons whirl. The old tree has been uprooted; it lies dead on the west side of the hall. Its limbs are bare, except for a single gold leaf lying against the wood. The workspace is shaking. The snowflake whirls in the fire-pit's smoky updrafts, as the Longhall shimmers into place. In moments the flake is losing its luster. Again it shimmers away. This time it sublimates into a smoke-ring, which drifts above you in cheerful disregard of the heat. [ACTION] invoke heat
