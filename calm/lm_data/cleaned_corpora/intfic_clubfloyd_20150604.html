Tried explaining to the patient after reading it which portions had happened and which hadn't. Effect of comment was almost immediate -- confusion, sorrow, then understanding. Patient began nodding and almost laughing with a sardonic smile on his face. Asked the patient to explain what had happened -- did he now understand the difference between things that had happened in real life and those scenarios he played out in his mind?

I've tried to summarize my understanding of it as best I can: The patient has - in his mind - somehow come unstuck in time. He speaks of it as if it were a malleable thing. He mentioned several times in his notes to me that he could 'save' moments, as if in a delaying glass. He kept several of them with him, and 'restored' them as he wished, reliving the past/present/future. When asked about the 'different' me he replied that he'd tried restoring several times, changing them -- seeing different paths that resulted. This, he said, was the best he could find. I asked him if he had saved a moment from before this all happened, before his 'infection'. Back when he was simply Cleve. He said he'd 'restarted' from time to time, but that it only took him as far back as his 'new creation'. The patient refused to speak any further of this infection. Please press SPACE to continue.

Patient claims change has resulted from an 'infection.' - Patient is a glossolalic though this is only revealed when he sleeps and cannot keep conscious control. I conclude that that 'change' was the onset of glossolalia, though the source is still unknown. - Patient claims the infection resulted from the 'secrets' he stole from a shadowy group he refers only to as 'them.'  I am still uncertain if this group is real and the patient has simply incorporated them into his delusions or if they were created out of whole cloth. - The infection was never intended -- it resulted from his hubris - even 'they' would never use it in such a way. Again, I am uncertain what this represents. Possibility - the patient has associated some action/event that took place in his life concurrent with the onset of glossolalia. - Patient claims the change has caused time to become distorted for him - it is not a linear thing. This may be an metaphor for the internal mental confusion of which the patient's inability to communicate is a symptom. - Patient refuses to discuss or even think on the infection - what it is, where it came from, if it may be catching. When confronted, patient cuts off all communication entering a semi-comatose state, often shaking the head spastically. Possible conclusion: The patient believes that his glossolalia is infectious and will spread if he speaks. This may be the key to his eventual recovery.

As you must well know by now,  I discovered the existence and nature of your enclave during my time at University. Excited by tenets so similar to my own: the celebration of intellect, the recognition of information as an entity rather than an idea, the embrasure and development of new technologies to unlock the mysteries of the Universe itself, I left my feeble schooling, gathered my few worldly possessions and came to study at your collected feet. But trapped in your antiquated and outmoded ways, clinging more to superstition and myth than logic and reason - you refused me. Oh, you commended my "ability to solve puzzles" and patted me on the head like a dog that returned a thrown ball. You allowed me to work for one of your lesser number, mindlessly churning out one insignificant apparatus after another - a mere journeyman in your archaic system. Undeterred, I remained near by, studying where I could, observing in secret and working towards one goal: proving my worth and value to you. Tonight I have the rare and singular privilege to tell you that not only have I proved, beyond doubt or measure, my value. I have exceeded you. I have succeeded where you have failed, and I have gone further than you ever dared dream. I have leapt the Sephinroth in one bound, from Malkuth to Kether. Kai theos en ho logos. I have heard that Word, Brothers - echoing across eternity. I have touched the mind of God - of Information pure and unsullied by the mere mind of Man. My contact was brief, but glorious. The brevity of it was, I'm sure, due to the crude and simple nature of your mechanisms. The resulting damage was, of course, regrettable, but once I relate to you the breadth and wonder of my experience, I think you will agree: exitus acta probat.

I have seen the face of God. How powerful, then, their little engines - to be able to rend the veil of the Temple to reveal the Holy of Holies beyond. It was with an unnatural calm that I set the gears and knobs, aligning the energy just as my calculations demanded. It was as though my whole being knew all my toil and effort had not been in vain. I have not the words to express the joy that surged through me as I flicked the final switch. The hole appeared slowly - so slow that at first I did not understand it to be a hole. The air above the pedestal warped subtly, the air bending the light as if it were a lens. Then, the warp became a bend, a break... I cannot explain it, but it was in that moment that I knew I was looking onto a place fundamentally different than the universe I knew. Under my breath, I whispered the Order's motto ... for that is what had come to be. My words hung in the air a moment, drifting across the opening... ...to be echoed against the far wall of Creation. Language fails me. The words...the words!  They echoed yes, they returned ... but they were not unchanged.

I remember it now as vibrations - echoing across the air, across time - and across myself. I carried them as waves, as if I were made from water, or aether. They penetrated me, passed through me. In that eternal moment, I and Logos touched and were one... And then the sparks, the smoke. The machines, long overloaded, broke down one by one in a shrieking of spinning gears and twisting metal. Axles broke, machinery shifted and then, instantly collapsing upon itself, the door I had opened slammed shut. The force of it lifted me upward, flinging me across the room to the cellar's far wall, and for a long time I knew nothing more. I awoke to find my hands and arms mysteriously burnt, the back of my head throbbing. I reached to touch it and my hand came back damp with blood. The engines were nothing more than so much melting slag. Of the hole, there was no sign. Before I dragged myself up the stairs, I once more whispered the words that had brought Malkuth and Kether into the same space and thought I heard the faintest ghost of an echo ... a wash of a ripple across the air.

On the front cover, a tree with ten branches. The design is composed of hundreds of gold-leaf 1s and 0s rather than lines. The pages stick in large clumps. Even when turned carefully, they pull out easily, reverting to a sticky pulp. Those pages that do keep their place are difficult to read. The dark green ink has run, the text melting towards the bottom of the page. Only snatches of text are still legible: "...the ATBASH of the Hebrews, the Scytale of the Greeks, Caesar's cypher; long have they been used to maintain the secrets of Magical Rites, clandestine endeavors and Political Intrigue. But these are ciphers created by men who believed in myths, for the benefit of men believing in myths. The Initiated Mind recognizes that information is more than just words on a page, it is secreted in the world around us; the great Symmetry of Nature demonstrates that all Life is encoded. Unlocking this Code is our Duty and Right as Humans, made Masters by God, to Understand the..." "...itself, Mysticism should not be discounted. We understand that Myths and Legends are often the misguided interpretation of the uninitiated to understand the Great Truths. Particular insight may be found in the Vedas, the Scriptures, and the sacred teachings of the Hebrews, whose Qabbalah reflect our own search for Life's Origin. It is from the Qabbalah that we take our insignia, the Tree of Life. It is unknown..."

[ACTION] examine paperback [STATE] The book is open to a marked page, labeled "Troubleshooting Your Magnetophone, A Home User's Guide..." 1. Problem: Nothing happens when I turn my Magnetophone on. Be sure that your Magnetophone is hooked up to a viable power source, and that the power source is active. If you are sure your power source is active, toggle your switch. 2. Problem: All I hear is static or I can hear other operators, but they can't hear me speak, or they do not answer. To broadcast, be sure to depress the TRANSMIT button each time you wish to speak. While the TRANSMIT button is not depressed, your magnetophone acts as a receiver, not a transmitter. Also, be sure to use proper etiquette while operating your Magnetophone. To let another operator know you wish to make contact, press the TRANSMIT button and use the universally accepted phrase "Calling CQ". If you fail to use this code, other operators may believe they are picking up the middle of an alternate conversation, and will not respond for fear of interrupting. 3. Problem: I can hear static and voices, but they are faint or indistinct. Magnetophone customers living in highly-populated, urban areas may experience transmission interference due to the presence of large buildings, crowded streets, and pollution. You may try alleviate to this problem by placing the Magnetophone by a clear opening - such as a window. If this does not fix the problem, you may need to purchase one of several amplification devices, designed to fit into your machine's expansion slot. [ACTION] push switch

The sound of a throat being cleared emerges from the machine's ancient hornshell speaker, followed by a thin, haunting voice. "Today." A breath. "We are uncertain how to ... date this ... entry. Time has lost much meaning. The gap between Homo sapien sapien and what we are now (Logos sapien sapien?) is confused and muddled. As is much that came after." "The Biblical references we remember seem to fit best." "'And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.' Genesis 11:11  And so it is. Kai theos en ho logos. The Word Made Flesh is spoken from every mouth that we have. We speak the language of angels with every breath." "We are made happy by this - and sometimes sad." "We know that once we were a singular - an I. Or a bad copy of an I. We were - or we came from - a Thomas Xavier. We remember him, when we thought we were him. We think that maybe we liked being him." "But now we are so much more." "And there is yet so much more to be." "The First Time was the growing - the becoming - of what we now are. It took time, and there was resistance. This, too, was sad." "But now there is joy." "The Second Time came swiftly after. We searched what we were and what we remembered and we deduced where we came from - and what we were before." "The Third Time is now upon us." "We have mastered the crude sciences that lead to the discovery of what we now know as our home. And soon, we shall reopen the door and find our parent - ourselves - beyond." "As Cleve so unwitting wrote so long ago: Malkuth is in Kether as Kether is in Malkuth. Soon Man and God shall truly be as one. And then the Unending Time will begin." "We leave this behind - a final monument to what we are and were. We do not know if there is any other I or We to find and listen to it. But we leave it nonetheless." "Goodbye." Having reached the end of the cylinder, the phonograph shuts itself off with a tiny "click". /(?? RESTARTperiodfirstrevisit ?? RESTOREbackrecallrelease ?? UNDObackreverseunmake ??
