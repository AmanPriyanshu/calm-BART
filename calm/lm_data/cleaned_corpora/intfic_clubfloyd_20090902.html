Burglar!" he yells, not considering the fact that it would be extremely stupid of a real burglar to smash an upstairs window when two whole families were in the manor. That doesn't really matter now, because the security guard, having heard the yelling, charges round from the front of the building and grabs you virtually from the scruff of the neck. "Right, you, you're nicked!" he bellows triumphantly. Soon, the police arrive, and you are carted off to the station to explain yourself.

[ACTION] south [STATE] Entrance Hall The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north. The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as only hysterical mothers can. You can also see a security guard here. To your horror, and to his glee, you walk straight into the security guard. He takes great delight in lifting you up and ejecting you out of the house. "Your name's not down, you're NOT - COMING - IN!" he bellows. Outside the front entrance You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides (east and west) of the house. You can see a security guard here. [ACTION] southwest

Why can't you inherit something like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north. The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as only hysterical mothers can.
