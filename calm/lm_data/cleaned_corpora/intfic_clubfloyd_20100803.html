[ACTION] examine me [STATE] Your skin is pale and dirty, and the knuckles on your right hand are bloody.  A pale mark encloses your right ring finger at the base, obviously a ring used to be there.  The dull ache that throbs in every joint and limb doesn't quite drown out the burning sensation around your chest.  By the feel of it several ribs might just be broken.  You realize that you are cold.  Very cold.  With this realization comes a reflex jerk as your body attempts to curl up to preserve body heat, and in response the movement sends jolts of agony from your right leg to your brain. The coach door whines quietly as it swings on its hinges, occasionally accentuated by a clatter as a particular strong gust of wind pushes it against the coach wall. It would probably be a good idea to find some warm clothes. [ACTION] examine cut

You were looking for Charles in the crowded pub and saw him beckon from a dim corner table with two of your drinking buddies from Astronomy; "Mark?  Where the hell have you been?" "Sorry guys.  Damn Ass-unac stopped me on the way."  Your friends laughed and pushed you into a chair.  "Here."  A beer magically appeared before you, and you downed half of it before looking up. "He's going to flunk me." "Shit, Mark, I don't get it.  You have everything... why are you wasting it?"  It was Charles, of course.  Your best friend and wingman; smart, sensible and just a little bit brutal about it. Your reply was drowned by the wind slamming the door shut behind a customer and Charles cursed. "Sorry guys, I have to go."He was clearly annoyed. "Hey, why so soon?"  It was Sandy to your right, asking. "The harbor master assigned me an apprentice at the lighthouse.  I'm not allowed to let him handle the machinery alone if the weather gets rough."  Charles looked apologetically at you and said something that was drowned in more clatter from the door. He pushed an envelope across the table. "Here.  Like I said.  Drop by my place soon, I've got stuff I need to show you." "You guys are thick as thieves," Sandy commented.  "Cheers for new beginnings!" "To new beginnings!" They had all toasted to that, and then the evening took it's usual course ending with you showing up somewhere you oughtn't be the next morning, and with no assignment to show for professor Asunac.

If your luck have taken a turn for the better this is the powerful beam of the Great Plains Lighthouse. You set off into the dark, a little uneasy.  Packs of wolves are not unheard of on the plain, not to mention bandits and the like. Limping, you trudge on, determined to make it through the night. Slowly, almost unnoticeable in the start, the stars start to pale and the sky begins to turn a lighter shade of gray.

Relief wash over you as you finally totter into a courtyard and hear the sound of gravel crunch under your feet. CLOSED CIRCLES Part II The courtyard of a lighthouse A lighthouse teethering on the edge of a tall cliff rises defiantly into the air.  Its weathered white wash is covered by a thin layer of gray salt, making it look dingey and old.  Behind it to the east an ocean stretches out into a blue haze where the rolling waves meet the gray sky above.  Beyond boulders to the west a wide open expanse of plains stretches as far as you can see, using a palette of green and amber, making it an ocean of a different sort.  A patch of gravel serves as a courtyard and is fenced in by the two wings of the lighthouse, sensibly shielding it from the brunt of the weather. Shrill shrieks from the seagulls sailing on the wind above pierce the constant din of waves breaking on the beach far below the cliff. Far to the west a flock of birds circle over a fixed spot in the plain. [ACTION] examine lighthouse
