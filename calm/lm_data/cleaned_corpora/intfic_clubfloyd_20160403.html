All the penny arcades were useless. Which is why human magicians like you are still around. [ACTION] examine dome

For all I knew, what was left of it were the two men who had jumped in right after me. I could hear their teeth clattering from underneath their gas masks. Somewhere around here had to be the that ominous trench. At that very moment, some heavy battery didn't want to to be left out and started ploughing the hilltop once more, just to be sure nobody would get off it alive today.

[STATE] "Oh terrible minutes! One fears death and could, in such times, yearn for death, horrorified by this kind of death. Been in two assaults; may there follow no more! Nothing more eagerly longed for than this, besides getting home in one piece. Where did all courage disappear to? We have enough of waging war. Not cowardice is this but humanness, rebelling against this barbarism, this ghastly slaughter."

Soon, the incessant bombardment had turned the hills into an unrecognisable moonscape of shell craters. When it rained, these turned into pools of slippery mud, threatening to drown anyone trying to find shelter. As both sides tried to prevent the other from gaining a foothold on the hills, there was rarely a chance for the troops to dig their own cover. When there was, they often discovered body parts of those sent in before them. To this day, there are an estimated 80.000 dead still lying unrecovered on the battlefields of Verdun and every square meter is sprinkled with, on average, five kilograms of metal from shell fragments. ------------------------ [ACTION] north

That favourite pastime past and present: patriotism. ------------------------ [ACTION] north [STATE] ( - How this game works, tactically speaking) The basic method of rolling up a trench as was practised during this phase of the war was to toss a few hand grenades around every corner before going oneself and to bomb out all underground bunkers the same way. It was seen as very secondary whatever other armament was carried. The only real alternative course of action was to fire blindly around corners, which was much less effective with most of the weapons available at the time. This assumed that the attacker had somehow managed to make it into the defender's trench. Since a frontal attack across no-man's-land in the face of the defenders' guns had been shown again and again to be utter suicide, it emerged that the most promising tactic for attacking infantry was to come silently at night and infiltrate a position unnoticed by its occupants. To make this work, it was necessary to take only a very small raiding party and to make as little use of light, firearms and explosives as possible in order to avoid detection. Of course, it was also conceivable to bombard a position with heavy artillery until everyone inside was dead. In fact, this was what was attempted most of the time. The downside to all these tactics was that they could be employed equally well by the defender to counter-attack positions that had already been captured. ------------------------ [ACTION] inventory
