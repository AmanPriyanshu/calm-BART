An ingenious Perpetuum Mobile, built of Pipes, Gears, & Screws of Archimides. Whereby the Force exhibited by Water as it pours into a wide Funnel drives the Drawing of that water upward, to fall again through a Spout into the Funnel--on & on, ad infinitum. The Design is that of a certain Portuguese & the Baron seems to have been impressed with it so as to have it realized as a Fountain. Now Water pours through the Perpetuum, falling out of the Spout & into the Funnel. The Splashings of the water combine harmoniously with the Grindings of the Gears & Screws.
