Droplets of water spattering your face bring you around long enough to realize that you've just splashed through a wide, shallow stream.  There isn't one within miles of your house. It's only when your legs give out completely and you end up sprawled on a grassy clearing that you realize the pain has stopped: you've arrived.  The "ship" is already here, hovering about 30 feet up and quietly humming.  Amazingly, they aren't clouding your thoughts like they did the last two times. You roll onto your back, bring the polaroid up, and start photographing the ship between labored breaths. The mechanical whine of your Polaroid drowns out the gentle hum of the ship.  Picture after picture comes spewing out of the camera's mouth. The fatigue from running catches up with you, forcing your head back into the thick grass.  Once your head is relaxed, there isn't much keeping your eyelids open.  You find yourself relaxing into darkness.  As your conciousness recedes, you start to feel things crawling into your hair, crawling in and you need to lift your head, lift your head up right now and push out of the darkness, get away from the things crawling in your hair, lift your head and wake up. You blink your eyes, and see that you're in a hospital ward.  Even after getting up, it takes you several moments to realize that this can't possibly be a hospital.  There's no bed, no instruments-- no doors, for that matter.  There is only blinding whiteness and sterility all around you. White Room The room is of uniform whiteness, and far too bright.

The first is from ten years ago: Springfield --  A man police have identified as Peter Knott walked into a restaurant with an illegal handgun  and opened fire  yesterday, killing  one  and  critically   injuring two others  before employees  managed to wrestle him to the ground. According to witnesses, he was screaming "Wife-stealers!"   repeatedly.  We talked to his  neighbors,  and learned that  Knott  is convinced  that aliens  have  been abducting him  for the  past  several months,  and the stress of his claims caused his wife to move out. At  the  urgings  of his  lawyer,  Knott pleaded  no contest at  his hearing  and has been  committed  to an institution  for  the criminally insane. The other is from just two weeks ago: Springfield --  Although ten years  have passed since  Peter Knott  went  on  his  murderous rampage,  the people of Springfield have not forgotten. Upon hearing that the home considered him rehabilitated and was considering  releasing him early, a large crowd gathered around the Mayor's office and staged a  loud protest on his lawn. The mayor promised to do his best to stop Knott's release, but unless the county comes up with more  money for  the facility,  they will have to release twenty patients and lay off several staff members in order to remain operational. A spokesman for the complex said: "We are only thinking of releasing those individuals that  have  responded  completely  to  their therapy and that  we believe  pose no threat to themselves or to others."

The gate-keeper pushes a button, and the heavy, wrought-iron fence is hydraulically pushed open.  The guard returns to your side and grabs your arm again.  They escort you across the plush lawn into the freshly whitewashed building.  They force you into a small room where they wrestle you into a straight-jacket, and then they take you to a classic padded cell, and put you inside.  Any doubts you may have had about the reality of your situation are quickly dispelled as you rub your face against the rough canvas padding on your walls.  The cell is real. Real enough, anyway. In a total of 544 turns, you have achieved a score of 175 points out of a possible 200.  You also received 15 bonus points. [ACTION] inventory [STATE] Time passes... You close the last twenty feet to the gate.  The guard on your right releases your arm to go talk to the gate-keeper.  The other guard clamps down painfully on your left arm.  The scene around you seems to blur; is it just your eyes tearing up from the pain?  You feel an all-too-familiar tingling sensation along your scalp, and the world comes into focus again.

The scene around you seems to blur; is it just your eyes tearing up from the pain?  You feel an all-too-familiar tingling sensation along your scalp, and the world comes into focus again. [ACTION] pull wire [STATE] You sense that this is probably your only chance to do anything, and so you seize on the one possibility that offers you hope.  You reach up with your free hand and pull on one of the wires with all of your strength.  The pain is incredible.  The guard realizes something is wrong when your knees give out from under you.  You can hear them frantically shouting something, but the words are lost behind a fine red mist of pain.  As the pain pushes you to the limits of your very being, you feel a moist ripping and the wire starts to pull free. Then, you thankfully lose consciousness. You awaken on the ground in the clearing where you saw the ship.  The morning is growing bright in the east.  Stiff joints protest your weight as you stand up amongst the litter of pictures on the ground. [ACTION] get pictures
