A gaping hole in the wall provides unexpected access to Mrs. McCaskill's room, where it looks like the sprinklers are going off.  Tissue paper trees line the intact east wall of this room, striving to brighten the desolation. You left a long table shoved up against the west wall.  Now, that table supports half the rubble from the collapsed wall and partially blocks your access to the gaping hole. The door to your classroom hangs open on its twisted doorframe.

Mrs. McCaskill's Room Half the ceiling has fallen, crushing the west side of the room beneath debris and blocking the door entirely.

A gaping hole in the east wall allows you back into your classroom, if you scramble over the rubble-strewn table in the way.  The north wall is in similarly poor state, but the choking smoke on that side ensures it's not a viable exit. Samir is here, carrying a striped green paper clip. A crumpled poster projects from the rubble, mostly sheltered from the sprinklers by a fallen corkboard. Water flows down the legs of the cheap wooden teacher's desk to the growing puddle on the floor. [ACTION] samir, unlock drawer with clip
