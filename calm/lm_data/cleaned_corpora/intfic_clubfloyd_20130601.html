[STATE] [Your score is 0 from a trivial 601.] Are you sure you want to quit (YES or NO)? [ACTION] yes [STATE] My dad came home late one night when I was nine and threw an old copy of the Monster Manual by Gary Gygax onto my bed. He woke me up, stressed and shaking at the humiliation his friends had put him through earlier that evening. He asked me if I wanted the book. I was still groggy, but I picked it up and thumbed through it. "We didn't play Monopoly tonight, Jarret," he told me. "That's because not a one of them can beat me. Instead, they brought out this... thing. Some 'game of the imagination'." He practically spat that last word. "You can move all you like without throwing any dice, but to actually do anything, you need to throw a handful!!" I was both reading entries on the different monsters and paying half-attention to his rant. "Five minutes in, Benson tells me that I come across something called a gorgon. That got me stoned. Why would I play a game that depicted the recreational use of marijuana cigarettes? I got up and left." "They let you read this during play?" I asked him. He nodded. I turned to page 49. "I don't think they were supposed to. It says right here that the gorgon can turn you to stone. It doesn't get you stoned. And right here are all its weaknesses! How did you not see this? Are you stupid or something? Or what?" My father snatched back the Monster Manual. He didn't state that what he was going to do was going to hurt him more than it hurt me. (I think all he did say was that he should have left his 'patented Duffy blast' on my mother's face the night I was conceived, which didn't make a whole lot of sense to me then.) He instead just quietly gave me a spanking for back talk. But as that 112 page reference to a modern mythology of villainy struck my bony behind, it was as if he were bonding the pages and me for all time. Like directed osmosis through anger or something. (Okay, it actually wasn't like osmosis at all, but I've sacrificed knowledge in basic chemistry for additional levels in Modern Mythology, so please cut me some slack on the occasional analogy outside of my experience.) In the week that followed, my father tried to ban Dungeons & Dragons from the house as he had previously banned video games, cursing, Cajun food and music recorded after 1959. I stood up to him on D&D;, though, and he caved for the only time in my childhood. Within a week I was running my own games for the kids in my tract. We were creating adventures together with Devils, Demons and Dragons and it was one of the best times of my life. My old man may have never been on the short list for an award from the PTA, but his maniac antics did a better job helping me understand just what I was interested in than the fathers of anyone else I grew up with. And heck, he did have my back that one time I met D&D; creator Gary Gygax himself at DragonCon and started kicking him in his bag of magic beans (if you're digging my ditch here) in misplaced, latent vengeance due to how hard the board stock was for those manual covers. I don't think you've truly bonded with your father until you've spent 36 consecutive hours in a holding cell mocking and taunting an inmate set consisting of multiple thirty-somethings decked out in homemade hobbit, fairie and chocobo costumes, where the only thing the lot of them had in common, aside from a complete lack of human dignity, was relating how difficult it was to sleep late when the sump pump went off.

We have to come all the way down here to rent because of the late fees on my memberships at all the video places back in the Fort. I wish I had a good story for why that is the case, but I don't. I'm just poor and had the first Lord of the Rings movie overdue for more than two weeks at multiple video chains. I kept it around to mainly prove trivia. (It will probably end up costing me more to show my friends that the elf character Legolas was walking on, and not in the snow, than it did for director Peter Jackson to implement that effect on-screen.) Supposedly, Audrey is dropping by tonight to watch a movie, which is why I'm even here to begin with. In the five years we've been together we've dumped each other a total of nine times. She is currently ahead of me six to three. Her most shallow dumping was when she wanted to exclusively hang around a hardcore goth guy who had somehow managed to finance or lease his own cemetery plot. That guy was the black fingernail Alpha male until he missed his first payment. To be fair, mine was when she filled out Student Loan paperwork for me without my knowledge or consent and almost enrolled me into classes at the nearby University of Central Hill. She doesn't like the fact that I work at the Funtime Teen Mall for $5.51 an hour at age 27. I have to work later tonight, so I guess I'd better pick something and get out of here quickly. [ACTION] l]

"What the hell was that in there?" asks Pang. "Who knows?" says Barnaby. "Who cares? Let's just go. At least by putting down the homeless guy inside he won't get grime nor slime over Duffy's windshield in some half-assed attempt to clean it." "I thought you knew that guy, Duffy," says Criswell, unhelpfully, as if that somehow explains why he was cowering in the corner.

[STATE]  [ACTION] look [STATE] I've only been on, really, truly on... once in my life. It was about five years ago. The first week of March. The Wizards of the Coast (the company that publishes all the D&D; books these days) were sponsoring a huge, two-day tournament in the Fort. I signed up for it with Barnaby, who used to be more into this kind of thing back then, and we started gaming it on a Saturday morning. It wasn't a 'competitive' tournament, per se, especially since around that time the two local gangs of Korean role players had pretty much wiped each other out when an on-line housing refresh dispute went from the virtual world of the internet to the physical one of reality, resulting in thirteen dead and seven wounded. That would have normally taken the edge off for the rest of us for the whole of the weekend, but we soon found out that WotC were putting up an eight-thousand dollar first prize for the weekend's 'Most Outstanding Roleplayer.' When I found that out, something clicked inside me, and I drew from a strength of personality I didn't know I had. All day the dice were with me. Just about every time I threw a twenty-sided die I got an incredibly favorable result. I started getting a bit more bold and soon found that the other kids at my table started following me. Looking to me for direction, for decisions, for witticisms. I became bolder and overly gregarious. I hardly needed any of the booty the game's Dungeon Master was giving us in-game, and won over the entire table through generosity. I was confident and having fun being me for the first time ever. My luck stayed with me when I went to different tables and played with different people. When the tournament finished the next day, I was awarded the top prize and a check for $8,000. I accepted it graciously and thanked everyone I played with for giving me the chance to shine. As Barnaby and I were rounding up our backpacks and bags of dice, I Xeroxed a copy of my character sheet, signed my name and phone number to it, and gave it to the cutest girl who seemed single during the event, someone I had played with on the first day. When I got home, I spent the entire check on a car and a new wardrobe. I had nothing left of it by Tuesday. Audrey didn't call the number on the sheet, maybe because it was a pompous act of nigh-Olympic level. But when she dropped by the Mall later that week I asked her out on a date. She said yes and has been in various states of flabbergastation with me over the years that have followed. I got my car, clothes and relationship within a lucky streak that lasted 48 hours five years ago. And I've been living off that success ever since. I'd confess that in my darker moments, when I am at my most honest, it rather spooks me to know that I have essentially been stagnant ever since. [ACTION] push enter

He woke me up, stressed and shaking at the humiliation his friends had put him through earlier that evening. He asked me if I wanted the book. I was still groggy, but I picked it up and thumbed through it. "We didn't play Monopoly tonight, Jarret," he told me. "That's because not a one of them can beat me. Instead, they brought out this... thing. Some 'game of the imagination'." He practically spat that last word. "You can move all you like without throwing any dice, but to actually do anything, you need to throw a handful!!" I was both reading entries on the different monsters and paying half-attention to his rant. "Five minutes in, Benson tells me that I come across something called a gorgon. That got me stoned. Why would I play a game that depicted the recreational use of marijuana cigarettes? I got up and left." "They let you read this during play?" I asked him. He nodded. I turned to page 49. "I don't think they were supposed to. It says right here that the gorgon can turn you to stone. It doesn't get you stoned. And right here are all its weaknesses! How did you not see this? Are you stupid or something? Or what?" My father snatched back the Monster Manual. He didn't state that what he was going to do was going to hurt him more than it hurt me. (I think all he did say was that he should have left his 'patented Duffy blast' on my mother's face the night I was conceived, which didn't make a whole lot of sense to me then.) He instead just quietly gave me a spanking for back talk. But as that 112 page reference to a modern mythology of villainy struck my bony behind, it was as if he were bonding the pages and me for all time. Like directed osmosis through anger or something. (Okay, it actually wasn't like osmosis at all, but I've sacrificed knowledge in basic chemistry for additional levels in Modern Mythology, so please cut me some slack on the occasional analogy outside of my experience.) In the week that followed, my father tried to ban Dungeons & Dragons from the house as he had previously banned video games, cursing, Cajun food and music recorded after 1959. I stood up to him on D&D;, though, and he caved for the only time in my childhood. Within a week I was running my own games for the kids in my tract. We were creating adventures together with Devils, Demons and Dragons and it was one of the best times of my life. My old man may have never been on the short list for an award from the PTA, but his maniac antics did a better job helping me understand just what I was interested in than the fathers of anyone else I grew up with. And heck, he did have my back that one time I met D&D; creator Gary Gygax himself at DragonCon and started kicking him in his bag of magic beans (if you're digging my ditch here) in misplaced, latent vengeance due to how hard the board stock was for those manual covers. I don't think you've truly bonded with your father until you've spent 36 consecutive hours in a holding cell mocking and taunting an inmate set consisting of multiple thirty-somethings decked out in homemade hobbit, fairie and chocobo costumes, where the only thing the lot of them had in common, aside from a complete lack of human dignity, was relating how difficult it was to sleep late when the sump pump went off.

We have to come all the way down here to rent because of the late fees on my memberships at all the video places back in the Fort. I wish I had a good story for why that is the case, but I don't. I'm just poor and had the first Lord of the Rings movie overdue for more than two weeks at multiple video chains. I kept it around to mainly prove trivia. (It will probably end up costing me more to show my friends that the elf character Legolas was walking on, and not in the snow, than it did for director Peter Jackson to implement that effect on-screen.) Supposedly, Audrey is dropping by tonight to watch a movie, which is why I'm even here to begin with. In the five years we've been together we've dumped each other a total of nine times. She is currently ahead of me six to three. Her most shallow dumping was when she wanted to exclusively hang around a hardcore goth guy who had somehow managed to finance or lease his own cemetery plot. That guy was the black fingernail Alpha male until he missed his first payment. To be fair, mine was when she filled out Student Loan paperwork for me without my knowledge or consent and almost enrolled me into classes at the nearby University of Central Hill. She doesn't like the fact that I work at the Funtime Teen Mall for $5.51 an hour at age 27. I have to work later tonight, so I guess I'd better pick something and get out of here quickly.

[STATE]  [ACTION] wait [STATE] I've only been on, really, truly on... once in my life. It was about five years ago. The first week of March. The Wizards of the Coast (the company that publishes all the D&D; books these days) were sponsoring a huge, two-day tournament in the Fort. I signed up for it with Barnaby, who used to be more into this kind of thing back then, and we started gaming it on a Saturday morning. It wasn't a 'competitive' tournament, per se, especially since around that time the two local gangs of Korean role players had pretty much wiped each other out when an on-line housing refresh dispute went from the virtual world of the internet to the physical one of reality, resulting in thirteen dead and seven wounded. That would have normally taken the edge off for the rest of us for the whole of the weekend, but we soon found out that WotC were putting up an eight-thousand dollar first prize for the weekend's 'Most Outstanding Roleplayer.' When I found that out, something clicked inside me, and I drew from a strength of personality I didn't know I had. All day the dice were with me. Just about every time I threw a twenty-sided die I got an incredibly favorable result. I started getting a bit more bold and soon found that the other kids at my table started following me. Looking to me for direction, for decisions, for witticisms. I became bolder and overly gregarious. I hardly needed any of the booty the game's Dungeon Master was giving us in-game, and won over the entire table through generosity. I was confident and having fun being me for the first time ever. My luck stayed with me when I went to different tables and played with different people. When the tournament finished the next day, I was awarded the top prize and a check for $8,000. I accepted it graciously and thanked everyone I played with for giving me the chance to shine. As Barnaby and I were rounding up our backpacks and bags of dice, I Xeroxed a copy of my character sheet, signed my name and phone number to it, and gave it to the cutest girl who seemed single during the event, someone I had played with on the first day. When I got home, I spent the entire check on a car and a new wardrobe. I had nothing left of it by Tuesday. Audrey didn't call the number on the sheet, maybe because it was a pompous act of nigh-Olympic level. But when she dropped by the Mall later that week I asked her out on a date. She said yes and has been in various states of flabbergastation with me over the years that have followed. I got my car, clothes and relationship within a lucky streak that lasted 48 hours five years ago. And I've been living off that success ever since. I'd confess that in my darker moments, when I am at my most honest, it rather spooks me to know that I have essentially been stagnant ever since. [ACTION] wait

On the tattered couch are the green blanket and the pillow.  Sitting on the entertainment center are the television and the DVD player. Inside the DVD player is the Lord of the Rings DVD.  Sitting on the table are Vecna's hand, the Dreamcast, the bottle of wine, a cup, the Blade DVD, and the The Truman Show DVD. Criswell, Pang, and Audrey are here. "Oh, Jesus Christ!" exclaims Audrey.

But she's not kidding around. "Are you okay? Did you hurt your head at all -- " She shakes her head in the negative. "Look, I'll check on Sydney, OK? Just relax, just stay still for a second..."

Her eyes begin to swirl. She begins to turn transparent, she starts to float... she rises off the ground, breaking the look of pure sex and hypnotism that she shared with me, and looking over the others. "Always the inadvertent knight in shining armor, no, Jarret?" she whispers. It's still Sydney's voice, but softer, much more melodic. "Syd?" asks Audrey. "Are you --" "Oh, I feel wonderful," she says, answering the question before Audrey can finish it. "It has been so long since I have walked among you all... Too long. I have forgotten how good it feels to take a breath of air rather than soot..." She crosses her legs and raises herself a bit higher. She begins to slightly glow. [ACTION] examine holder

[ACTION] examine holder [STATE] It's a wooden stand, roughly four feet in height. It has three protruding grips on top to hold a smallish crystal ball (which is present). The base is circular in shape and rather thick. An animate human skeleton staggers into the store from outside. Its walk is slow, considered and focused, as if controlled by an inexperienced puppeteer. It has in its fingers a bloody and seeping severed head, which it discards to one side of the room. Audrey lets out a quick scream of shock when she sees it hobble in, and I grab her arm and get her behind me. The skeleton's head swivels quickly from right to left as it gives the four of us on the ground a haunting peer. I scan the room and recall what's in my pockets and trying to find a decent weapon.

[ACTION] hit skeleton with holder [STATE]  I clobber the skeleton with the crystal ball holder. (The crystal ball holder breaks as a result, and I throw it down.) "Choke it all down!" I scream. The skeleton collapses and falls to the ground. "Excellent, Jarret," Sydney rasps to me, from above. "It could not handle being hit that way..." "Skeletons are susceptible to blunt attacks." I shrug in a despondent attempt to mask my fear. "Y'know, Syd, I was thinking of just pulling off my trousers there for a second and breaking it into kibble with the Hammer of Thunderbolts that lives in my pants, but I didn't want to knock down all my friends in the process." She ignores my comment, as if unable to process it and feeling me not worthy of inquiry. The skeleton's weakness has been in every revision of the Monster Manual over the years. It's one of the first -- "It's one of the first things you learn when playing D&D;," says Sydney. A terrible smile crosses her face. It's terribly effective. I try to show no fear. (No additional fear, anyway.) "But that's an artifact of the game," I say. "It's a made-up construct. Something to give them a little more personality. There's no real-world basis for any of it." Keep thinking, Duffy, keep your mind busy, don't let this telepath get into your hea-- "Probably not," she says. Her eyes turn empty and glow. "But who can tell? You have complicated my return slightly, but not for much longer. The look into your mind I obtained when we touched was so insightful. You're made up of so many deep, arbitrary little undead rules, rules you need to learn and exceptions you need to note." "What? Those aren't mine! I didn't make them!" "They will be. They are. You will find this place governed by them when you return to it. My power within this world will grow and that should keep you busy..." The room becomes much colder. Barnaby grabs me by the collar and leads the four of us out of the Bead Store. Gibs drags me out of the Bead Store as I try to plead with Sydney (or whatever is possessing her) to use anybody else as her template tonight, to give us back our friend, to let us all go. The room just keeps getting colder, and my words and breath form puffy clouds that fall short of reaching her. She never wavers in her silent smirk. We leave the Bead Store and collect ourselves out in the foyer. Most of the lighting in the Mall is now completely gone; lit instead by the moon through the skylights. "Fuck this fucking mall," says Gibs. "Let's go get Trott and get the fuck out of here. Jesus Fucking Christ." "I don't think we can just leave," says Audrey. "Why not?" "The thing that possessed Sydney said that the Mall will be governed by the arbitrary rules she found floating about in my head," I say. "With the showing of the skeleton, I think she means the undead rules." "What undead rules?" asks Gibs. "What are they, specifically? Which undead are we going to encounter? What will they act like?" "Who are all you people?" says Casey in a voice like Gibs's, making fun of all his questions. "There's a progression," I say. "In the D&D; undead table, it goes skeleton, zombie, ghoul, shadow, ghast or wight, wraith, mummy, spectre, vampire, ghost, lich... and then 'special.'" Gibs reflects on that for a couple seconds. "Ah. Sure. Special like Special Olympics, or -- " "Special like they can kill with a scream or single touch." "Yeah." Gibs shrugs. "I guess that's pretty special." "Wait," says Casey. "Do you hear that? There's something groaning out there, in that direction." She points to the west. "Can you guys hear it? It sounds like there's a lot of them." "I'll get us out of here," I say, quietly. I don't know if the others are paying attention to me. "I'll keep us all safe..."

"I ordered some red 20 sided dice before the tourney over the Internet. They were weighted to give out mostly 18s, 19s and 20s. What? What's the big deal? That was years ago!" "Ssh!"

"I can't believe you essentially commit white collar crime." Audrey shrugs her shoulders. The ether(?) that makes up the vision dissipates completely and it completely disappears. Audrey sits herself up against the east wall of the store. "So you found a comb, I see," says Audrey. "Maybe you can do something with that mound of straight hay on top of your head with it." She gives me a smile after she says that to let me know it was said with affection. "It's a silver comb," I tell her. "I'm sure it's quite valuable."

I'm sorry. I don't mean to complain." I embrace her for a few moments and rub my hands over her bare shoulders. "I'll keep you warm..." She nods. "Silver definitely worked on the shadow," I muse. "It used up the comb, however. But the same thing'll work on the wraith. We just need to find more of it.

She is wearing a torn black tank top, blue bandana with floral print, and sleek pair of tight shorts. Her build is slight -- she is probably about five foot five at most, with slim, athletic legs. The girl's arms and right leg have been nailed to a makeshift cross, and the cross seems solidly affixed to the western wall. There are cuts and tears elsewhere on her body as well. It is difficult to tell how long she has been dead, but she is not sending off a waft of stench or anything, currently. She looks a lot like a girl that used to work in the paint and housewares store that used to be here in the Mall before they closed. I remember that she was really bright, resourceful, helpful and was working on her four-year degree. I really hope it's not her. She is dead.

The walls are made out of a flecked brick, and a support beam stands to the right of the coffin. Exits are south towards the stairs and east into a tight alcove. The lid is here. I see two bandaged hands slowly emerge from darkness. They grope at the sides of the coffin. A figure rises, I see first the unwrapped, rotting head and then the torso, wound tight with stinking fibers and rags. The mummy turns its head directly towards me.

The mummy slowly begins to moan, seemingly within a weary, endless pain. It quickly shifts this to a scream. Its keen is of a deep tenor, and it begins thrashing about. Small scraps of deteriorating bandages fall from its person and onto the floor. The mummy strikes the support beam! Chunks of the ceiling fall downwards and it sounds as if the entire Mall has collapsed a little. The chaos breaks me out of my fear-trance. I feel I could flee now if I wanted to try. The mummy attacks and hits me! I feel awful after that last touch. [ACTION] south

Audrey continues her story, but I start to get a flood of memories back from that night. I had actually deigned to go out clubbing with her for a night a few weeks back. (I usually don't, as I am such a lousy, self-conscious dancer.) She was wearing this tight little gray dress with slight horizontal lines across it, made out of this fuzzy fabric -- the outfit practically squealed 'do me' by itself. Audrey was grinding her way up against me every time I went onto the floor. I just seizured out. That's the only way I know how to dance. I almost never really consume much alcohol, but that night I was taking pull after pull of some Safeway Vodka that Sydney had smuggled into the club as if the contents of the bottle were nothing more innocuous than Mexican Kool-Aid. Audrey and I took a cab back to her place, and we were all over one another before we could find the light switch. She was on top of me for what seemed like the better part of an hour when she dipped down and whispered something into my ear. Tye-mela'ne. It's Tolkein Elvish for 'I love you.' We don't seem to say that to each other very much, but even drunk I instantly translated what she said and I... well, I went off like a Soviet Catapult: unexpectedly, unpredictably, and altogether quite messily. I hadn't thought about it -- about the consequences of it -- until just right now. I didn't mean for her to go through a pregnancy scare like that by herself. I just wasn't thinking about the details. (For what it's worth, the story that Audrey related as I had this flashback was pretty much exactly like mine, except that she said that we only jammed for something like fifteen minutes.

They carry a large assortment of tabs, pills, drugs and spices. The Court has another section to the west, and there is an exit east from where we came. Audrey lets out a little surprised 'yip!' and runs over towards me. "Jarret!" she says, "I felt something brush up against my leg! Something's here, in this area with us!" Before I can pooh-pooh her objections to this area, a metal chair comes flying at us. It appears as if a poltergeist has infected the food court. A fluorescent light, a garbage can, a brown table, a short gray table, a plastic chair, a metal chair, a broken chair, and some chair parts are here. The vampire and Casey are here. Audrey and Gibs follow me. The Revenant arrives from the east. I notice something moving over in the far corner of the Food Court. It's a girl. She is wearing a reserved violet dress and has the most perfect, slim little figure I have ever seen. The vampire, I guess. It has to be; she's just as stunning as Gibs said. Focusing harder, I see Casey beside her, unmoving, defeated, completely obedient. The vampire whispers softly to her -- Casey snaps back into proper consciousness, and after a moment begins to look at her with loving trust. They are both several yards away, but I can make what the vampire says to her perfectly: Follow me, my pet. The vampire heads off to the west. Casey heads off to the west. [ACTION] northeast

The walls are a sickly shade of green which some junior ad exec no doubt thinks promotes quick sales decisions, when all it truly does is make customers eager to get the hell out before they add an equally off-putting color to the surrounding by use of their own acrid vomit. In the rear of the store is a modest plastic counter and an ancient analog cash register. Further behind that is a closed metal door that really clashes with what's going on otherwise, stylistically. There is no front gate to the Nutrition Store, only a ten foot cut in the wall. The opening is not quite centered, however, and a 5'x3' pane of glass has been placed into the southern wall.

My breath turns into wispy, stringy clouds the instant it leaves my lips and I begin to feel my very bones come across a deep chill. I usually prefer winter to summer, so normally I wouldn't be put off by the frost down here and a few bad smells, but there's something different about the chill in the air down here. The temperature of the air seems malevolent, almost. The ceiling of the basement is about five and a half feet high, so I have to lurch over like I'm the hunchback of Notre Dork just to get around. The walls have a very rough texture to them, as if they were blasted away and then sanded down in a very half-assed manner. The corridor continues into darkness to the north.

Audrey continues her story, but I start to get a flood of memories back from that night. I had actually deigned to go out clubbing with her for a night a few weeks back. (I usually don't, as I am such a lousy, self-conscious dancer.) She was wearing this tight little gray dress with slight horizontal lines across it, made out of this fuzzy fabric -- the outfit practically squealed 'do me' by itself. Audrey was grinding her way up against me every time I went onto the floor. I just seizured out. That's the only way I know how to dance. I almost never really consume much alcohol, but that night I was taking pull after pull of some Safeway Vodka that Sydney had smuggled into the club as if the contents of the bottle were nothing more innocuous than Mexican Kool-Aid. Audrey and I took a cab back to her place, and we were all over one another before we could find the light switch. She was on top of me for what seemed like the better part of an hour when she dipped down and whispered something into my ear. Tye-mela'ne. It's Tolkein Elvish for 'I love you.' We don't seem to say that to each other very much, but even drunk I instantly translated what she said and I... well, I went off like a Soviet Catapult: unexpectedly, unpredictably, and altogether quite messily. I hadn't thought about it -- about the consequences of it -- until just right now. I didn't mean for her to go through a pregnancy scare like that by herself. I just wasn't thinking about the details. (For what it's worth, the story that Audrey related as I had this flashback was pretty much exactly like mine, except that she said that we only jammed for something like fifteen minutes. She's got this crazy, post-Einsteinian view of how time really works though, so don't believe her.) [ACTION] northeast

There are three very solid walls here and a roof made not of thatch, but poured, cracking cement. The floor is hardly comprised of peat or mud, but the same tile present everywhere else in the Mall. A fair bit of ether has snaked itself into the room. It combines with the hand-picked and market-researched atmospheric lights that still function to give off a very deep, defracted and soothing look to the room. Vibrant purples and deep blues dominate the walls and counters of the Sunglasses Hut. I worked at this place for a week once when I was fighting with my manager at the D&D; store. I acquired a little bit of trivia regarding this place (for instance, the center display case will open if it's tapped upon) but nothing useful otherwise. Audrey and Gibs follow me. [ACTION] south

Focusing harder, I see Casey beside her, unmoving, defeated, completely obedient. The vampire whispers softly to her -- Casey snaps back into proper consciousness, and after a moment begins to look at her with loving trust.

There are three very solid walls here and a roof made not of thatch, but poured, cracking cement. The floor is hardly comprised of peat or mud, but the same tile present everywhere else in the Mall. A fair bit of ether has snaked itself into the room. It combines with the hand-picked and market-researched atmospheric lights that still function to give off a very deep, defracted and soothing look to the room. Vibrant purples and deep blues dominate the walls and counters of the Sunglasses Hut. I worked at this place for a week once when I was fighting with my manager at the D&D; store.

She spotted the group of the anonymously parked lorries sitting in the lot and ran towards one. I took Casey's hand and brought her to them. The van would give us a few extra seconds relief from the daylight that would kill her. I brushed Casey's hair away from her face. I couldn't help a tangential glance at the bite marks on her neck. They were terrible, fascinating... beautiful. Members of my generation have had hundreds of thousands of tattoos and this was more striking than any of them. "I'm not going to give up on you, Casey," I whispered to her. She offered no response. Trott, Gibs and Sydney joined us. I tossed my keys to Trott and told him to bring my car around. Casey hadn't made a sound since we had left the Mall. "I'll get some blankets for you," I told her. "We'll cover you up, get you to a hospital, get you a transfusion..." Audrey let out a little sound of a cry. I saw that her cheeks were streaked with tears. She had been so silent I hadn't noticed. I jumped flat-out of my skin when Casey grabbed my arm. She opened her eyes. They were blank, as if her eyes had rolled to the back of her head. But she was still able to lock onto me and stare right through me. "I don't want to live like this," she said. Her voice was so soft, but her grip -- her nails were digging through the sleeves of my jacket, almost breaking the skin on my wrist. "I won't live like this," she said. "You already all look so tempting. You, Jarret... I can't stop thinking of what it would be like to just take the littlest sip from you..." She released her grip on her own. She was still in control of herself, albeit barely. "And you," she said, a wry smile forming on her lips as she looked up at Gibs, "You would have been delicious..." "That's not the vampirism talking," whispered Gibs. Casey turned slightly and faced me again. "The sun. I feel can feel it already. I won't be able to make this decision tomorrow night. Tomorrow will be too late." She rose until she stood, giving no pause to worry about leverage or looking slightly awkward as she took to her feet. She hugged me. She hugged us all, one by one, until only Audrey was left. Casey gave her a kiss on her cheek and Audrey finally broke down. They embraced. And as terrible as I felt for Casey, it was killing me that my girl was having to go through the mechanics of saying goodbye forever to her best friend. "There is no other group that I would like to spend my final moments with," said Casey. "I will miss you all." I took Casey's hand and pulled her up as we climbed on top of the truck. I tried to tell her that I could find a way to heal her, to fix her -- that there was still time. But she was staring straight ahead. The sky continued to turn brighter. We were up there for less than a minute, but it felt like I had tried to argue with her and talk her down for ages At exactly 7:21am she briefly turned to me with a sad smile and stretched her arms out as wide as they would go. I grabbed hold of her in an attempt to drag her down, but daylight peeked out over the horizon and instantly vaporized her. She disintegrated away into a whiff of dust and only the smallest bit of her was left in my hand. Her clothes fell to the top of the van. I heard Audrey shriek from below. I picked up Casey's clothes and hopped down to the ground. I opened the passenger door to my car and directed Audrey in. The rest of us dispersed and went our separate ways. I drove up to the Fort, expecting to drop Audrey off and go home. She brought me inside and together we both crawled into her bed. She fell asleep quickly, and within moments I was hypnotized by her rise and fall. We both slept for most of the rest of the day. After about twelve hours I fell back into consciousness. I kissed my girl on the lips, but she only stirred, smiled faintly, and fell back into sleep without ever opening her eyes. In the modern mythology I don't follow, a kiss on that is supposed to wake up the girl when it's delivered by her own Prince Charming. It just made it all the more obvious that I've never been that guy for her. I slipped out of her room and drove myself home. Four months later... [ACTION] hit enter

[ACTION] hit enter [STATE] I thought the five of us would have difficulties explaining what happened in the Mall right after the incident. I thought there would be questions, interrogations, solicitors and then time in locked rooms downtown before good cops gone bad, and then thrown off our case, but at the last second rehired because they always got results.

The bodies were removed, either when the ghost vanished or by carry-out after the fact. I never found out because I was too much of a coward to ever research what officially happened to them. It was easy to not get into a nervous furor about things with my friends because I hardly saw any of them afterwards. Gibs treated missing his shift that night as a power ploy and ended up getting promoted and the afternoon drive-time slot. Sydney I only ever saw through Audrey, and Audrey moved to Texas at me a week after what went down in the Mall. I mean, right at me. (If it could be said that someone could aggressively move 'at' somebody, I mean. If that's possible, then that's definitely what Audrey did.) Trott was the only one of the group that I ever encountered with any regularity, and that was because we worked together. We never spoke about that night.

[STATE] I thought the five of us would have difficulties explaining what happened in the Mall right after the incident. I thought there would be questions, interrogations, solicitors and then time in locked rooms downtown before good cops gone bad, and then thrown off our case, but at the last second rehired because they always got results.

Shelves of gaming books and modules are arranged everywhere, and promotional kiosks occupy the floorspace between the register and the far wall. In the last few months, Benji has decided to sell all sorts of other worthless crap to increase the profit margin of the store. This includes, but is not limited to, baseball cards, DDR mats, stuffed Japanese Gromit Dolls, stripper poles, headphones and joy buzzers.

Trott shifts uncomfortably. "I think it's high time we talked about it." I look him dead in the eye, but Trott doesn't respond. "C'mon! What the fuck went on that night?" I start to get really agitated and animated. This is how you need to be to get through to Trott sometimes. "All that undead? What was all that? How on earth have you rationalized that in your mind?" Trott looks around for a cigarette. He finally finds one and takes a long drag on it. "Truth to tell, Jarret... heh. I deal with it every day by remembering to completely forget about it. I put it all out of my head. Let me tell you a story." Trott offers me a cigarette. I accept. Trott exhales a long stream of smoke. "When I was in college, a few of my friends and I were playing with a ouija board. I had never done it before. And neither had my friend Raida. We were both put together on the board, on opposite sides, naturally. As first-timers, this was going to be of interest to the old pros." "Naturally," I say. "Well, the 'spirits' were asked a bunch of questions. We saw the planchette moved intelligently to the different letters. I know for a fact that I didn't move it. I am pretty sure that she didn't as well. What we saw and what we were told through the board spooked the hell out of us. The spirits knew our names and threatened us and told us that they were going to suck down our souls and so forth. There was only one thing that bugged me, though." Trott frowns. "Well, actually, the entire thing shocked the living Christ right out of me. But anyway. At one point Herr geistenhaus was asked which one of us they were going to get first, me or Raida. The ghost said that it was going to be me, and spelled my name out T-R-O-T-T. Three instances of the letter 'T.' Immediately after, a similar question was asked, and Raida's name came up. Her name was spelled -- by the spirits! -- with the letter 'I' and not 'Y.' So not only are those beasties in contact with us on the physical plane, but they also instinctively knew how to spell our names with all our crazy variants. Oh, and it referred to me by my last name rather than my first. Of course." "What the hell is your first name, anyway?" I ask. "Sveinsgeird?ttir," says Trott. I wouldn't have guessed that. I would have gone with 'John' if pressed. "It's Norse," says Trott, helpfully. "Anyway. I borrowed the board a couple nights later. I set it up on my bed. Raida and I put it backwards to us, and we closed our eyes. I set up a webcam to record what happened on the board." Trott takes a thoughtful puff. "And what happened later, away from the board, too, as it turns out." He shakes his head to remove a quick smile based on old memories. "We got back gibberish from what we asked. You'd think the banshees and demons could account for the board being oddly placed, but they couldn't, apparently. Ah! Ah! Ah! There is something called the ideomotor effect, I later learned. But the point is... there's plenty of standard explanations for remarkable things that happen that everyday. So Sydney was 'levitating.' Sometimes magnetism looks like super powers. It got cold in the Mall. Fuck. The power was out. And when is it ever not cold in the Mall? July? People turned into monsters..." "Admittedly, tougher to explain," continues Trott. "Maybe the government tried out an ebola strain on people." He lowers his voice. "People like Rudolph. Er, Randolph. Whoever." He looks around the store to make sure nobody else has wandered in. "It's already legal to create a bot and just let it run loose around town. I don't know for certain. But I do know that I am not prepared to blindly believe in anything. I don't mind playing role playing games and being a dungeon master and whatever else, but I certainly won't baaa-baaaa my way around life and absorb every pseudo-supernatural event I encounter like a peanut-brained little sheep."
