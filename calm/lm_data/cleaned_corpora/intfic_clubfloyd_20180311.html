So I think I will have a name someday soon, although I do not know how I get a name. Is it something I have to do? Is there somewhere I have to go? All I know is that for now, He calls me just one thing: Cat. New Cat A slice-of-life adventure from a feline perspective,  by Poster  Soft Place You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some of that again. He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about. There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You must be related, because you both are called Cat. You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out. Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.

It's pretty loud, and it's coming from nearby. [ACTION] forwards [STATE]  Kitchen Here enormous metal boxes reach upward from a shiny floor that you can skid across if you run fast enough and suddenly stop. The tallest box is cold, vibrates, and smells like food! The shorter boxes also smell like food, but not as strongly. The whole area smells like trees -- a fresh, outdoors kind of scent, which doesn't make sense, because this is indoors. Goodcat/Badcat is in this room; his scent is strong. You whip your head around but don't see him anywhere. Is he waiting to pounce you? You continue looking around carefully. Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a pathway, over a shorter box and connects to the tallest one. It's wider than the ledge in your place. In the middle of the floor is a large brown circle held up by four legs. Underneath it are two smaller versions, with one pulled away from the other. You wind your way around these things and quickly smell what their names are. The large thing is called a table. The smaller things are called chairs (one is His and the other is guest). The names seem strong, but dull. You hope He doesn't name you any of those names. You hear the sound of grooming coming from somewhere nearby. The phone on the table nearby rings, and it's loud!

It must have another name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat.
