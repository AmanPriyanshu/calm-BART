Although this area is mostly picked since you and Honey and Grandpa came this way when you started picking this morning. You can still find some ripe berries though. Through the blackberry tangle, there's a trail going down along the creek shaded by lush green willow trees. Back the way you came is the clearing where Honey and Grandpa have been picking. You hear a dog barking in the distance across the river. [ACTION] down [STATE]  Blackberry Trail This is a trail running roughly parallel the creek with tall blackberry brambles on either side. In one place, there are Willows hanging down over the trail that tickle the back of your neck as you duck under them. It looks like the trail used to continue further on down the creek on this side, but is now hidden by underbrush -- though you could try to follow the lost trail. Farther on down the creek, the trail turns to cross an overgrown stone bridge. In the other direction, up the path, is the tangle of blackberry bushes. [ACTION] go trail

You go down down down letting yourself fall slowly until you feel a jolt as your feet bump the rocks at the bottom of the pool. In the moment before you run out of air, you look up at an enchanted underwater world. Fingers of sunlight flicker through the green twilight. Even the very water around you shimmers before your eyes. You push off the bottom and return to the surface with a gasp of delicious air and climb back up on the rocks. You feel courageous.

Swimming hole Down a long wooded trail that zigs down the bank, you emerge from the thick woods, and the trees open up to the sky. The swimming hole lies before you, a deep pool carved out of and surrounded by smooth granite rocks. It is big enough that you can swim like they taught you at the YWCA from one end to the other, and deep enough to dive off the rocks. It is possible to walk along the rocky shore downstream to another spot along the creek. Back up the trail leads through the woods back to the dirt road.
