The expedition was headed by their old tutor from Blackbow, Percival Vitus Peck; Victor and Alva, who had just moved into their estate at Nightshade, young and full of mischief before they had a young Klaus to worry over, decided it would be a legendary lark to infiltrate Percival's expedition and reassign the ownership of some of his finds. So they donned preposterous disguises, feathers, false beards, dark glasses, long robes and longswords, and blustered their way into the dig site, where they stole this altar out from under Percival's nose.

Weak ghosts often inhabit statues and sculptures, of which there is (or was then) no shortage at Nightshade, and once inhabiting a statue, like a hermit crab inside a shell, the ghost can only be shaken loose and expelled with the proper magic formula: the magic word, followed by the given name it bore in life, followed by its hidden spectronym.
