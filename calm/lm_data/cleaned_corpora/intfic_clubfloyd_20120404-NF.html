[STATE] Bedroom  (on the bed) You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It has the basic furnishings, but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom; another door is set into the wall across from the window. You rub your eyes, stretch, and get out of bed. %% Critical error. %% Message: Input generation number does not match. debugcheapnitfol quit with exit status: 1 ATDT3635377 ATDT3635377 CONNECT 1200 CONNECT 1200 **************************************** *                                      * *                  /                   * *     ENDLESS BBS // 172-END-LESS      * *                 /                    * *                                      * *     (c) 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987       * *                                      * *     SysOp: Endless                   * *                                      * *     Co-SysOpz:                       * *         Bordz: Lninja, Ultrex        * *         Gamez: Nameless, Warden      * *         Warez: Crossbolt             * *                                      * **************************************** **************************************** ENDLESS BBS MENU B>ordz    C>hatz G>amez    M>ailz W>arez    Q>uitz 120 MINUTEZ REMAINING!

You try to force yourself to stay awake just one moment longer, but instead you drop dead! *** You have died *** Bedroom (on the bed) You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It has the basic furnishings, but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom; another door is set into the wall across from the window. You rub your eyes, stretch, and get out of bed. > W Hallway You are standing in a nondescript hallway: plain white walls, a threadbare runner carpet. The door to your bedroom is at one end of the hallway, the first door on the right-hand side at the top of a flight of stairs that spirals downward to an unseen lower floor. There is no other end to the hallway; it stretches on forever to the north, with doors at regular intervals. > D You follow the curving staircase downward... Foyer You are standing in a small area of parquet at the bottom of the stairs. The staircase back up to the second floor lies to the west; a hallway leads north, and this one looks mercifully finite. To the east is a dark room lit by flickering, ghostly light, and the door outside is to the south. > N Hallway You are in a hallway with a slightly uneven, creaky wooden floor. Archways to the north and west lead to large rooms full of adventurers in brown cloaks; to the south is a foyer and, beyond that, the front door. > N Game Room This is a large room - apparently a later addition to the original house, if the faux wood paneling and hideous mint-green shag carpeting are anything to go by. In the near corner stand a quartet of arcade cabinets, while at the other end of the room, near the entrance to the library, is a pool table; a couple of adventurers are playing a game of 9-ball. Empty and half-empty beer bottles are everywhere. A dartboard hangs on the wall opposite the main egress, which lies to the south. There is a single hole in it. You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one, but you do read these: LABYRINTH, MAGIC, MACHINE, DWARVES. The table once occupied by the gamers is no longer in use. > S Hallway You are in a hallway with a slightly uneven, creaky wooden floor. Archways to the north and west lead to large rooms full of adventurers in brown cloaks; to the south is a foyer and, beyond that, the front door. > S Foyer You are standing in a small area of parquet at the bottom of the stairs. The staircase back up to the second floor lies to the west; a hallway leads north, and this one looks mercifully finite. To the east is a dark room lit by flickering, ghostly light, and the door outside is to the south. > E TV Room The lights are off in this room, but you can still see reasonably well, thanks to the glow of the boxy big-screen television. And what you see is a room full of clones of you, all in adventurers' cloaks, sitting on battered couches watching Rocky IV on Betamax. An archway leads north into the kitchen. You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one, but you do read these: COTTAGE, ROC'S NEST, TROLLS, JEWELRY SHOP, KNIGHTS. (Some of these alternate versions of you are chatting with each other and no one seems to mind.) On the TV, James Brown sinks to his knees. Danny Ray drapes a cape over him. > N Kitchen It looks like this kitchen has been updated piecemeal. The sleek black refrigerator with in-door water and ice dispensers is clearly one of the latest models, while the beige and brown buttons on the wood-grain microwave speak of an earlier generation, and the loudly chugging teal dishwasher a generation before that. The oven is of indeterminate age, though the fact that the clock on it is analog rather than digital suggests a relatively early date. A screen door leads north to the backyard, while an archway to the south will return you to the TV room. One of your doubles tidies up the kitchen. > N Backyard This is a small backyard, marked off by a tall wooden fence. A small patio of volcanic rock tiles plays host to a grill, which a couple of your doubles are tending to, while out on the grass stands a small shed and a recycling bin. A gate leads east. > S Kitchen It looks like this kitchen has been updated piecemeal.

Apollo Creed dances around and throws the occasional punch. > W Foyer You are standing in a small area of parquet at the bottom of the stairs.

The table once occupied by the gamers is no longer in use. > W Library This is a small room whose walls are lined with overflowing bookcases. At the center of the room are two comfortable-looking chairs, each with a round table beside it; on each table is a lamp. The wall across from the entrance is dominated by a bay window, through which warm light streams. The first alter ego you met sits in one of the chairs, reading his newspaper. > E Game Room This is a large room - apparently a later addition to the original house, if the faux wood paneling and hideous mint-green shag carpeting are anything to go by.

One table features hot wings and tandoori chicken; another offers assorted varieties of pizza; a third is split between pasta and enchiladas; there's also a snacking table with some Mediterranean spreads and pita chips, and a table of plates and napkins and things. And as no buffet would be complete without dessert, one table is devoted to different types of pie. All around, versions of you gorge themselves, either at fold-out tables or just standing up.
