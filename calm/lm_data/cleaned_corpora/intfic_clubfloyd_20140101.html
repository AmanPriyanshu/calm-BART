[ACTION] put snake in bag [STATE]  (first taking the snake) Hey, that isn't supposed to work! There! Now you only need to find a way to warn Paul not to open his bag before the landing. You really need to find a way to communicate. That's what your therapist always said, too. Then Paul's foot comes down and flattens the toilet bag accidentally. Ouch, poor snake. But before you can wonder, there is white light and ... Row 54 (on the seat) This is a standard row of seats. Somebody (presumably your mother) is yapping on about something. Two rows up from you, you can see Paul and the Assassin, seated side by side. [ACTION] examine me

You're not sure this is how reincarnation is supposed to work. Staring intently at them, you can see the assassin pull something that looks vaguely like a full-polymer Glock 7, caliber .308, using octagonal polygonal rifling rather than the hexagonal shaped bores used for models in other chamberings. It has a 8 round magazine and is fitted with a full-plastic third party silencer, possibly made by Fischer-Dieskau. [ACTION] east
