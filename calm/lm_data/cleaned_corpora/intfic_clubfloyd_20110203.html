[STATE] Outside Old Shack (on the horse) The streambed turn east here and vanishes into the thick bushes and weeds. To the west is an old run-down shack which looks several years past its prime. There is a hitching post just outside the door. On the horse you can see a pair of saddlebags (which is closed). You pull yourself onto the horse.

[STATE] "Beetlebaum!" [ACTION] blizzard [STATE] Beetlebaum races off through the brush at breakneck speed, stripping you of all your possessions. The landscape flies by as the old horse seeks the shelter of George's shack so as not to have to brave the oncoming blizzard. Following nearly invisible trails, the horse breaks out of the brush onto the main trail. Without hesitation, the horse continues north along the trail across Clear Creek and then northeast toward Blind Canyon. As the horse makes the last turn into the canyon, Beetlebaum startles at the sight of something up ahead on the trail. At this point, you and the horse go your own separate ways. Beetlebaum falls to the ground, quickly regains his footing, and continues his journey north to shelter. You, on the other hand, fly through air with the greatest of ease until falling face first onto the dusty trail. As you get up and take inventory of your faculties, you feel something cold against your head and hear the click of a gun's hammer. Blind Canyon The trail winds its way from the southwest through a shadowy canyon formed in the cleft of two large hills. You cannot help but feel confined and vulnerable by the sheer walls of this gorge and the limited visibility in front of you and behind. The trail continues to the north. You can see Black Thad McGee here. "Well, what do we have here? Huh, little missy? Seems like you and me have some unfinished business." Thad puts the pistol back into the holster.

[STATE] Black Thad pulls out a pistol from his holster. The sound of a galloping horse fills the canyon! [ACTION] beetlebaum [STATE] Black Thad carefully checks the gun for bullets. Black Thad's eyes turn big as saucers as he spots the daunting sight of George and Beetlebaum racing down the trail at full gallop. Beetlebaum's eyes are filled with rage, his nose flared, and thick white foam spews from his mouth. Just as Beetlebaum lowers his head for a full charge, George screams out in an earsplitting yell, "HERE COMES BEETLEBAUM!" Black Thad, out of reflex, goes for his right gun first to shoot the charging horse. His thumbless hand fumbles the gun around and then drops it to the ground. In an instant, but an instant too late, he goes for his other gun with his good hand. Beetlebaum, with his ears back, plows into Black Thad like a freight train. Black Thad is launched into the air from the collision and slams into the canyon wall. What life may have been left in Black Thad is certainly concluded by the ensuing rockslide. After the dust clears a little, George stares at you for a moment and says, "I just knew you'd be the one to clean up around these parts. Heck, when I tricked ol' Frank into goin' above to rile yuh up, I could just feel it in mah bones. Beetlebaum, get yer miserable hide over here!" As Beetlebaum saunters over, still wet with sweat, George opens the saddlebag and takes out a blue gumball and hands it to you. "Go on, get on home! I don't take to no good-byes from no woman." George pauses, and then breaks out in a big smile and chortles, "Ah heck, ya done good. Hell, ya done great. I's can't thank ya enough fer helpin' out. Let's get some grub and get ya on yer way." After a pleasant meal of beans and jerky, you say your good-byes to the old cowboy. Following a long hug and a quick peck on the cheek, you finally partake of the blue gum. Quicker than an instant, you find yourself....                      (Press SPACE to Continue) On the Floor You are lying on the floor staring at the ceiling.

Dismissing the previous events as a bad dream, you continue your routine and get ready to start dinner.

The note reads: "Thank you ma'am for all your help on getting things settled around Deadeye. With the Biscuit Brothers and Black Thad out of the way, people are startin to move back towards town. There's even talk about reopenin the mine and maybe drillin some more wells. Beetlebaum is feelin spry as a colt, and hell, I may even rebuild the ol Gumball Factory.
