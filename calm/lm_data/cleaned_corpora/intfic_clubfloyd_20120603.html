Download all the Hugo MiniComp games from [LINK], or try searching on the Interactive Fiction Database at TADS.org ([LINK]). This game, Retro-Nemesis, was originally a piece of static fiction that I wrote for Jason Scott, to be included on the discs for his documentary Get Lamp. Jason had requested that I write a crazy little text file about what the filming of the movie might have been like. He was going to include it in a 'hidden in plain sight' directory to see if anyone found it. It was hidden so well that the duplicators assumed he didn't want it included on the discs at all. Rather than let the story be lost to time, I have tried to rework it for the Hugo MiniComp. As such, there are vast oceans of text broken up by a valid move or two. To talk to people in the game, just use TALK TO JASON and so forth. You can download my other games at Jolt Country, and I hope you enjoy the Hugo MiniComp! For more information on programming in games in Hugo, try [LINK], or the Hugo by Example website at [LINK] The original story was proofread by my friend Zseni.

[STATE]  Boat Shore The boat shore is actually the innermost nook of the small bay where you swim in the summertime. It's a small nook with some reeds and water plants, and a nice gravely sea bottom without any sharp rocks to hurt your bare feet on. The wavebreak protects the bay, so the water is usually pretty calm and sometimes it gets really warm in the summer. There's a small wooden boat, but nobody has used it in a long time since you can't go to the sea with it, just row around the bay and very close to the island. Your house and the yard is to the southwest and the wavebreak stretches to the east, towards the mainland. Straight to the west are your mother's rose bushes, that hug the side of the house, but you really don't want to go through them because the thorns are sharp enough to bite even through your clothes. The roses are in bloom and gusts of wind wafts their sweet smell to you. Gogol trots after you. [ACTION] southwest [STATE]  Front Yard The front yard of the house is full of color. Mother has dotted the place with flowerpots and crates, and even small patches of grass. Mother takes very good care of the yard, she says it's her small patch of paradise. There are two small and gnarly trees with needles and a brown bark that shadow the yard a bit. On the other side of the yard there is an outbuilding, which is painted red and white. The double doors to the outbuilding are open, it's very dark in there and you don't really want to go inside. Next to the outbuilding is the red outhouse. To the south is the bare rocky center of the island with all the moss and stuff, and you can get to the boat shore and the pier by going northeast. By going northwest you get to the back yard, from where you can climb to the tall hill behind the house, where the navigational cairn is. Gogol trots after you. [ACTION] south
