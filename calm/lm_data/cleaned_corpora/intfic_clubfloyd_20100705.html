Their meat is surprisingly tasty, considering their appearance: their body is spherical, perhaps as large as a beach ball, and six long, thin, insectile legs protrude from the equator of their body. They have two small, stubby, antennae, and a dish-shaped organ at the top of their head that allows them to "see" the world around them using a type of echolocation called mimsing. However, at the moment they are in a panic, not at all mimsy. They blindly bump against the wire fence around the pen. The cause of their disturbance is obvious: one of them seems to be badly hurt, and lies motionless in the center of the pen. Beware, though; they can still smell you, and in their confusion, they seem to classify you as a threat. You'll have to get rid of the wounded animal or else they'll never calm down.
