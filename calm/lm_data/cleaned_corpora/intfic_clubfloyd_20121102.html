"It'll come back," you say, half-reassuring, half-pleading.  Except it, of course, doesn't.  None of it does. A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to all the others on this corridor.  The carpet is a greyish-blue, only slightly stained.

[STATE]  You are determined not to leave this place this time without Celine. [ACTION] talk to celine [STATE]  Celine is not feeling so good and will only tell you so if you press her.  She has - quite literally - forgotten the way home, along with everything she learned on her art history course last term.  She has forgotten the tombstone cake you made for Jess's birthday.  She has forgotten Rick's parents are dead.  She has forgotten the entirety of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It'll come back, you tell her, don't worry, and anyway we can watch it all over again - think how much fun that'll be.  She listens, and laughs, and pretends. [ACTION] again

[STATE]  Suddenly you remember.  It's time to go home.  "Will you follow me?" you ask, and Celine nods.  She seems only a little afraid. [ACTION] east [STATE]  Sun Room This is a primitive conservatory of sorts.  It is by far the most attractive room in the Warneford, which reflects well on neither the Warneford nor the room.  It has wicker chairs and, disconcertingly, there is white-sheeted hospital bed against one of the walls.  The square, unbeautiful windows overlook the grounds and currently admit a spill of moonlight the colour of old milk. As you enter the sunroom from the gardens, your own footsteps sound on the floor but you hear no others.  Perhaps Celine has not followed as promised she would. The Vaughan Thomas corridor lies to the east. [ACTION] east

An over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do nothing to break the monotony.  The Warneford Hospital has a distinctive smell.  It is the smell of a place that very consciously has no smell, underscored by a desperate edge of nicotine. You strain to hear even the slightest hint of movement but there is nothing, nothing at all.  Perhaps you have been tricked.  Yes, that seems very likely. This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south. East would take you outside again, through the blue door. [ACTION] east

There is also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench. The only thing that follows you now, it seems, is silence. The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.

Here, there are no country house lawns, no sandstone and classical pillars. There are patches of scrubby grass, borders that may perhaps bloom one spring, and scattered buildings that are too perfectly, facelessly functional to have anything of beauty or ugliness to them.  There are jaunty painted signs to Cotswold House and Wintle Ward. Vaughan Thomas waits to the west, the Hospital Approach is to the east. [ACTION] east
