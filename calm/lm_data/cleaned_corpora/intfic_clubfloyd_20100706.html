Tall Pines The mountain trail continues under a canopy of tall shady pine trees. The trail continues down to the southwest, and up to the east. To one side, you see a fox, its hind leg caught fast in a steel trap. [ACTION] eat fox [STATE] Before you can eat the fox, you will have to kill it. You take out your knife. But the sight of the knife terrifies the captured animal! "DON'T EAT ME!" it says weakly. Its voice is female. The words, faint as they are, freeze you where you stand. It's not merely that you're never heard a fox speak before. You haven't. But somehow, she has invoked magic here. Like a ritual. Or a promise. Or an oath. "DON'T EAT ME," the fox says again, stronger now. Or perhaps the world has gone silent instead, to hear her all the better. "If you spare me and free me, I will help you later. You will not regret it. "Do you accept my offer?" >> [ACTION] yes

[STATE] A sudden breeze blows by; leaves fly by in its wake. "Then free me, man," says the fox. [ACTION] pry trap with stick [STATE] It's awkward, but using the walking stick as a lever, you successfully pry the steel trap open without causing further damage. Freed of the trap, the fox gets gingerly to her feet. "I thank you, man. I will remember my promise to you, and return when your need for me is greatest. Until then, fare well." You watch as she hobbles away into the forest and is lost from view. You then take a moment more to SNAP the trap closed and pick it up. Waste not, want not. [ACTION] southwest

Its large reptilian eyes stare at you, and you back up a step. You suddenly realize you are face-to-face with a deadly monster. It is still only the size of a wolf, true, but that is plenty big enough, and somehow you forgot that wolves can be dangerous too. "Be at peace," says the dragon. "I have no love of mankind, nor that hated iron. But you alone need not fear me. You have helped me as I asked and our bargain stands. I will remember my promise to you, and return when your need for me is greatest. Until then, fare well." You stop breathing when the dragon jumps, but it is only to catch the air in its leathery wings, and then it flies off into the distance.

Tall it is here, and tall it remains as it traverses a great C-shaped arch around the lake. Halfway into that arch is a majestic waterfall, pouring its liquid bounty into the waters below. Then look you further. Also on the cliff, opposite and across the lake, is a village and castle. Be it a true kingdom or the strange keep of barbarians, you do not know, but it must be an abode of men. Civilization, at last. The scene as a whole sings with vitality and life.
