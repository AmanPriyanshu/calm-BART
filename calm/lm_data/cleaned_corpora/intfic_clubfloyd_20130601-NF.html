Even if one were able to travel back and forth, there would be no way to alter the course of events.  This does not rule out free will; rather, it is stipulated that free action is accounted for -- the time traveller's comings and goings have, in a sense, already taken place.  You could not go back in time and prevent your own birth, for circumstances would intervene to make this action impossible. The second theory is that the timeline branches when a time traveller moves back and forth.  A traveller from the future may disrupt the possibility of returning to the same world he or she left behind. Some say that time is an infinitely branching tree, with each moment containing a universe of all probable or possible choices, and the time traveller slips around from one to the next, with free will being a crucial factor in the consequent events. A third theory has been recently posited, and is the core of this particular book.

[STATE]  READ BOOK There are two main theories about the potential for time travel.  The first is that time is linear and immutable.  Even if one were able to travel back and forth, there would be no way to alter the course of events.

A setting of 2 indicates a jump ten years into the past.  A setting of 3 is a safety position, or "Off" setting, understood to mean a jump of zero time, neither forward nor backward.

[STATE]  The time machine manual contains no information about that subject. [ACTION] look up red button in index [STATE]  After years of refinement, the operation of the time machine has been reduced to the simple push of a button.  Once the knob has been set, pushing the button will activate the machine.  However, if the machine attempts to make a jump beyond its imposed safety limit, the alert bulb will flash and no jump will occur. In addition, a safety feature is built into the machine which deactivates the button for a period of time after each time jump.  Due to the heat generated in the engine of the time machine, immediate successive jumps will cause its parts to fuse and become useless, a rather dangerous occurrence for a time traveller to face.  Therefore, the time machine must cool off before the button may be successfully pushed.  Fortunately, this only takes a few minutes (depending on the climate).  See also:  alert bulb, knob, platform.

A pool of white water catches the reflected and refracted light and spins it back into the room, where it is caught and re-refracted.  The original source of the light seems to be a series of pinholes in the roof of the cavern high above, but you don't think it could be sunlight.  You have lost track of how deep you have gone, perhaps twenty, perhaps forty feet under the surface, but too far down to see sunlight, you would have thought.  It is possible that sunlight has periscoped down a set of small crystal encrusted shafts that lead far enough up to see the open sky.  In any case, it is literally mesmerizing to be here.  The only exit is a tunnel to the west. You see crystals here. [ACTION] examine crystals
