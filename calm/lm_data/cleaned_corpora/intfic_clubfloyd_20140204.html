This has been the largest single loss ever attributed to the unseen "Cattle Butchers". The cattle were found scattered across Mr. Dexter's ranch, all with their tongues bodily torn out and frequently other signs of violence. Mr. Dexter has been so affected by this grim occurrence that he has sold his ranch and moved to Europe. Before leaving, he stated, "I have a mighty good notion as to who's been slaughtering my herd. I am not a cowardly man, but I have no desire at all to mess with them. I am leaving this place for good." Mr. Dexter went on to say that his move had been planned for some months, but the recent catastrophe spurred him to move immediately. For the last two years, occasional mysterious cattle mutilations have been occurring on the local ranches, but generally no more than one or two cows have been killed in a month. This newest occurrence seems to signal a possible upsurge in this strange chapter in the American Southwest. [ACTION] examine times

[ACTION] read scrapbook [STATE]  There are several articles bundled in the scrapbook, all dealing with the town of Castronegro and all dating back over thirty years.  The articles report the mysterious disappearance of infants from the Castronegro area.  At first, these disappearances were attributed to the still-unpacified Apaches nearby, but gradually the vanishings were just left as a mystery.  One other article tells the story of the disappearance of a Castronegro man visiting Albuquerque in 1892; a case similar to that of Joaquin Vileila-Pareia.  The other articles are dated 1890, 1898, 1902, and 1918.  In the 1898 article, a Castronegro man named Bernardo Diaz is named as a prime suspect, but there is no information as to whether or not he was ever arrested. The final article seems to be just general information about Castronegro.  It reads as follows: Castronegro is a small New Mexican town, located about 40 miles north of Silver City.  It was founded in 1680 by a wealthy Spanish nobleman named Bernardo de Diaz.  He led his family and another family, the Vilheila-Pareiras, there from Spain.  The town's original name was Agua Blanca, changed later to Castronegro early in the 18th centry, for an unknown reason. In 1728, during the Inquisition's suppression of Madrid Freemasonry, many Spanish refugees fled to Castronegro. Castronegro is much as it was when first founded over 200 years ago.  It has a population of about 600, and the town's only tie with the outisde world is the weekly bus from Silver City, as phone lines have not yet been installed.  It is a scenic example of Spanish America. [ACTION] up
