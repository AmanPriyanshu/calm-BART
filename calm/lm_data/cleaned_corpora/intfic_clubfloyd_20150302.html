The WorldScaper 7.0 Quickstart Guide rests on the workstation. Ringway East This long circular hallway curves away to the southwest and northwest. Strips of subdued lighting along the walls glow a gentle blue, almost overwhelmed by the huge, dark room behind the windows to the west. Through the thick glass you can see the sealed xylosphere. There are a pair of glass double doors to the east with the ObCorp logo stenciled on them. Ringway North This long circular hallway curves away to the southeast and southwest, while heavy security doors mark the entrance to the control tower to the north. Strips of subdued lighting along the walls glow a gentle blue, almost overwhelmed by the huge, dark room behind the windows to the south. Through the thick glass you can see the sealed xylosphere. Central Security The roots of the main control tower run through this room, piping commands around the station.  Banks of monitors display surveillance images from around the station, and there's a large placard on the wall with a list of station rules.   The Ringway is to the south and stairs lead further up into the tower.   A dank, earthy stench comes from a darkened hallway to the north. A glistening trouble tank has been installed here.  It contains a solar beam. Nock-Infested Hall This north-south hall runs between the control tower and the maintenance and engine wing.   The walls are encrusted with nock barnacles which glisten in the light. [ACTION] north [STATE]  Parking You're in a large parking hangar filled with rows of powered-down vehicles neatly parked in spaces marked with glowing guide moss.  The Planet Roller is here, parked in the aisle.   It's hard to make out much else in the low light, but there's a hall to the south and a smaller office to the east.   Moist air is coming from the darkness to the north. You can see a Tunnel Roller (empty) here. [ACTION] east

[ACTION] examine calendar [STATE] The calendar is covered in pictures of male Xyloids in full bloom. You haven't seen very many of them, since they're grown in special gardens where kids aren't allowed, but you've looked up enough pictures to know that someone messed with the colors on them to make the flowers look brighter, and that's way more pollen than they're supposed to have. They must have added it for some reason as a prop. Looking at the pictures for too long makes you sort of uncomfortable in a weird way. [ACTION] examine switchboard

The driving controls don't seem too complicated, and after a little initial skidding in circles you manage to get them down pat, even if you do have a little trouble reaching the foot pedals. This thing even has a solar butt warmer to keep you from getting hungry while driving in the dark. Speaking of your butt, you just realized you were sitting on something.  Upon picking it up, it turns out to be an operator's manual.  You can read it if you need any help figuring out the rest of the controls. [ACTION] read manual
