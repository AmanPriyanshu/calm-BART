[ACTION] k [STATE] The waka floats in the deep ocean, the sun motionless and searing in the clear sky. Mui, the trickster, casts his fishing line into the depths of the ocean, tied to his magic hook made from a human jawbone. Almost immediately the hook catches, and he pulls up an enormous fish that somehow becomes, as you watch, an entire continent. On that new continent magnificent dinosaurs -- taniwha -- prowl the dark forests. Volcanoes dim the sky with smoke and stain the air with the stench of sulfur, but the land is rich and fertile, and Mui's older brothers look on it with greed in their eyes. Mui watches them, deep in thought, with a faraway expression you can't read. Then he turns to look directly into your eyes, and says, "You know that some of my brothers cannot be trusted. You must keep them from carving up this great fish until I return from the gods with the proper karakia." And suddenly he's gone, flying away into the sun in the form of a seabird, and you're left floating in the waka with Mui's brothers as they smile secret half-smiles to each other and reach for their knives, and you wonder what in the world Mui thinks that you, twelve-year-old Tim Cooper, can do to stop them before they carve up and defile...

Aotearoa An Interactive Adventure by Matt Wigdahl  Difficulty Level: Introductory            Cruelty Level: Polite *** First-time players should type ABOUT *** A hand gently shakes your shoulder, and the in-flight magazine falls off your chest as you startle awake. "Sorry, Tim. We've arrived," the stewardess says, and passes on. But the dreams don't leave with her, and the rest of the trip passes in a haze: the terminal; the tall Mori man with fierce tattoos on his face who greets you on arrival; the trip through unfamiliar streets to a Conservation Service cutter. In a way it's a good thing. If you had to think about what you're getting yourself into, you might be too afraid to go through with it. You stand on the prow of the small ship, fear and excitement swirling around inside you so you can hardly tell them apart. You're going to see real, live dinosaurs, and that's great, but you're alone and afraid, and nothing is familiar here, and that's... not great. The man, Eruera, walks up to stand beside you, taking in the same view, shading his eyes with a powerful hand as he looks forward. The whipping ocean wind tries to carry his words away, and his accent is thick, but he has a friendly, open smile. "Don't worry about your flight getting delayed. We'll catch you up to the other group in no time." He studies your face, sees the concern. "Come now, you must be excited to start, yes? Everyone is! You are ready to work?" Excitement gets the upper hand for now and you grin just a bit -- you can't help it. "I still can't believe I got picked to come! I get to see real dinosaurs? That's so cool!" Eruera laughs, a startling, wild sound. "You may not think it is quite so 'cool' after picking through dinosaur roka for a few days, Tim." You cock your head a bit, not quite sure you understood. "Roka"? He just looks back at you silently, the friendly grin growing a bit wider. Oh. The Prow The cutter's hydrofoil brings the ship high out of the water -- high enough that there's very little spray. The wind whips past as the boat glides across the ocean off the coast to port. Thick, deep green bands of forest snake along the coastline to port. The treeline tracks stretches of black sand beach, sharp cliffs of dark volcanic rock, and the occasional salt marsh. The ocean glares as you look at the shore, almost overpoweringly blue. A dark feather from some sort of seabird flutters in the wind, caught in a small gap in the guardrail. You hear an incomprehensible yell from the general direction of the bridge. Eruera turns toward it, then closes his eyes for an instant. "I told them to double-check those gaskets," he sighs. "I'd better go help them before we're dead in the water." He starts to leave, then turns back to you for a moment. "Why don't you head to the bridge? They've got sandwiches in there; I'm sure you're hungry after all your traveling. I'll catch up with you after I sort things out below decks."

A small door leads inside to the bridge, and a rectangular opening in the deck leads down a steep ladder into the hold. You fumble the tools around as you walk. They're so bulky that it's hard to keep hold of all of them at once, but you manage somehow. White seabirds pace the cutter for a while, then wheel away. [ACTION] in [STATE] The Bridge The cutter's small bridge looks like it also serves as a living room and smoking lounge. The ship's controls are laid out on a cluttered panel to forward, under a wide, grimy window. A low side table stands by the door, food trash surrounding an overflowing, smoldering ashtray. A few chairs are scattered around as well. A door leads outside and a ladder leads down into the crew quarters. The captain drums his fingers on the console. The captain turns and notices you holding the hyperbolic torsion spanner, and reaches to take it. "Thanks, son... Took you long enough, though. Now put the other ones back." He then turns and yells down the ladder to the lower deck. "Hey, mhunga wai! Here's the hyperbolic torsion spanner!" He tosses it down the ladder. You hear a yelp of pain, followed by a clatter as the tool falls to the deck. The captain mutters, shakes his head, and returns to work. The radio erupts with a quick burst of staticky conversation, which the captain ignores. You can't make out a single word. [ACTION] out

Eruera pops his head up from the staircase. "Is that you, Tim? Hold on a second..." He looks down and waves someone on, then turns back to you. "Good! I think we are almost done here -- I will meet you on the prow when we are finished. That will keep you a bit more out of the way while we test whether the repair will hold under pressure." He vanishes back down the ladder. The captain checks the controls, then gives a grunt of apparent satisfaction. [ACTION] down

[ACTION] fore [STATE] The Prow The cutter's hydrofoil brings the ship high out of the water -- high enough that there's very little spray. The wind whips past as the boat glides across the ocean off the coast to port. Gathering clouds dim the light, almost hiding the dark green bands of thick forest snaking along the coastline's inky beach and charcoal cliffs to port. You spend a couple of minutes looking out over the ocean, watching the waves rise as dim lightning glows in the depths of the stormclouds and distant booms of thunder shake the air. It's a breathtaking scene, and for a moment you don't notice Eruera pushing through the wind from aft to stand beside you. He watches the approaching storm in silence with you for a moment as the light dims. "It looks like quite an wh coming our way. Perhaps you should come back in to the bridge before it hits. I would hate for you to get soaked and miserable before we even get to camp." You consider it as the sky darkens further. It's not a bad idea. But as you start to agree, Eruera snaps his head up, startled by something in the distance to port, and cuts you off with a raised hand. "Tim, did you see..." Without warning, he seizes you in a powerful grip! In one smooth motion he wrenches you off of your feet and pitches you over the starboard railing, so quickly you don't even have time for a scream before you're tumbling towards the sea, arms pinwheeling. Just before you hit the water you catch a single brief glimpse of Eruera poised to leap, one hand on the railing and a wide-eyed look of panic on his face. Then you plunge into the ocean with a stinging jolt, seawater jetting up your nose and your limbs painfully forced into unnatural positions by the water's drag. As you tumble and slow, there's a terribly loud crash of thunder. You flounder, stunned, trying to remember your swimming survival lessons. By the time you orient yourself and manage to look around, it's all over. But everything has changed. The cutter is half-submerged and leaning way over on its side, a huge, ragged hole punched in its port side near the stern. Twisted pieces of deck and the remains of crates are strewn over the ocean, visible in brief peeks over the rolling waves. But even though the panic rises up and your breathing is shallow and fast, you know you have to stay afloat. You start paddling toward the ship, but before you can cover even half the distance it has sunk low in the water and you realize there's no point -- it will be gone before you can reach it. You tread water for a moment as you look around, thrashing your legs wildly to keep your head above water and continuing to force down the panic. It seems you've gotten turned around somehow -- which way was the coast? Please press SPACE to continue. In the Ocean You are treading water alone in the ocean as a sudden summer storm drenches your face with sheets of rain. Lightning flashes and sledgehammers of thunder batter your ears as you try to get your bearings. The slightly acrid taste of engine oil mixed with seawater seeps into your mouth and makes you want to constantly spit; the bad taste and the floating debris are the only reminders that there was a ship with a living crew skimming over this water just minutes ago. The rise and fall of the ocean waves all around you limit how far you can see, and the storm blocks out the summer sun like an eclipse. In the confusion, you lose your grip on what you were holding, and everything is swept away in the fury of the storm. Even the backpack is lost, the cheap straps ripping away as you hit the water.

You can't really muster up much hope that you'll make it to shore, but at least you've got something to cling to, and you're not alone. That's way, way better than where you were a couple of minutes ago. You start kicking, trying to push the crate in a direction -- any direction. You can't tell whether you're making any progress. Eruera tries to encourage you, but his words are cut apart by the storm and garbled by your own exhaustion, and you can't make sense of what he's saying. You keep kicking until your legs fail. You rest, then try again, a cycle that gets shorter and shorter as you slowly run out of energy. All of a sudden, an unexpectedly violent surge of the sea tears you loose from the crate, and in a strange calm you briefly slip under the waves before kicking upwards again with leaden feet. By the time you reorient yourself, the crate is out of reach, scudding just ahead of you before the wind. It's so close... but you have nothing left in your legs, and you can't quite reach Eruera's arm as he stretches out towards you. Slowly, unstoppably, the distance increases, carrying the crate into the dark and leaving you behind. The last thing you see is Eruera straining toward you, trying to yell something over the fury of the storm. But the thunder, wind, and rain drown his voice and he finally disappears into the gloom.

Eruera sits up laboriously, takes the bucket from you, and tips it into his mouth. Water spills over his face as he drinks, and he closes his eyes in bliss. What seems like minutes later, he lowers the bucket. "Thank you, Tim. That's much better!" He gathers strength for a minute, panting for air a bit after downing the water. Finally he beckons you closer. "Tim, I'm sure the cutter was attacked, and I'm pretty certain it was by poachers -- criminals who illegally sneak ashore to capture the taniwha and sell them abroad. I'm not completely certain where we are at the moment, but if I'm right there should be a Conservation Service station about thirty miles to the north." He grins and spreads his hands. "Obviously I'm in no shape for such a trip through the bush, so it is going to fall to you to get to that station and get us some help. I'll try to answer any questions you have, and if you encounter anything unusual in the area you can always ask me about it." He steels himself, then twists, reaches into the pile of debris, and pulls out a solid-looking metal case. A huge smile spreads over his face. "By blind luck, that crate we stumbled across in the ocean had a set of field radios in it. They were in a sealed case, and they're pretty rugged, so they should still work." He hands you one of the radios and shows you how to push the button to make a call. You try it out, and the radio works perfectly! "With these we should be able to keep in touch in the field! If you run into anything, just give me a call." Having this link back to Eruera, even if he can't really get to you to help out, loosens up a tightness in your chest you weren't even aware you had.

[STATE] The obvious exits are northeast and west. [ACTION] northeast [STATE] You head off across the field toward the coast, happy to no longer have to push through the buggy undergrowth of the forest. You get maybe fifty yards away from the treeline when you hear human voices and the rumbling sounds of a truck engine to the northeast. The voices seem to be arguing. There's no way this could be the station -- there's no tower! But if it isn't a Conservation Service station... You freeze, very conscious of how exposed you are, and desperately hope no one pokes their head over the slight ridge between you and their camp, which must be just out of sight to the northeast. All of a sudden the field radio squawks to life. "Tim? How's it going?" Horrified, you drop to the ground and fumble for the radio, then hiss back. "Quiet for now -- someone's close!" You listen very carefully. The argument seems to have stopped, but you can't tell if that's because they heard you or if they resolved things themselves. Slowly, you creep back to the safety of the trees, and when you are confident you're screened from view you call Eruera back. "OK, we can talk now." Eruera responds quickly. "Tim, what was that?" "I'm positive the poacher camp is just over a hill, not very far to the northeast. I could hear engines and loud voices." Eruera's voice sounds very strained. "I beg you, take great care, Tim. I'm sorry it has to be you making this journey, but you must stay away from these men. Stick to the bush and keep heading north." "OK, Eruera. Not a problem. I don't want to be caught by these guys either." "Good luck, Tim. Stay safe." You stand still for a moment, breathing hard, trying to calm back down. But no one is coming, so you seem to be safe for now. [ACTION] listen

Centered in the valley floor is a large mound of volcanic rock, venting what looks like smoke or steam from a fumarole on top. The surrounding rock is riddled with cracks, crevices, and fissures, and hidden in one of the larger depressions is a very large bird's nest, which doesn't look completely intact. The forest trail leads upslope to both the north and south. A huge flightless bird steps back and forth around her nest in agitation. She looks like she's at least twice your height -- maybe three times! She can't be anything but a nesting moa. Nagi scampers in your wake, curious to see what you're going to do next. After looking around, you decide this location is worth asking Eruera about, so you pull out the field radio and place a call. "Eruera, I've stumbled across a pretty strange area." "Could you describe it, Tim?" "Well, there's kind of a mini-volcano in the middle of a clearing here..." Eruera interrupts you, sounding amused. "Well, it probably is! There is a great deal of volcanic activity all over Aotearoa, and it certainly wouldn't be unusual to run across hot springs or a fumarole." "Oh! I didn't know they were that common. Are they safe?" "Reasonably. Don't go jumping into one, but most of the time these aren't particularly active. They might lead to hot rock, somewhere below, but around here there's not much risk of a full-scale eruption." "OK, thanks." You eye the moa as it paces back and forth, then click the transmitter again. "Um, Eruera? I had one more question. Can a moa be dangerous?" "Ah! There's a moa there? Well, I'm sure if you ran right up to it you'd probably get attacked, but they're usually pretty cautious of people. As long as you keep a reasonable distance from it, you should be fine." You continue watching the moa, which still seems to be staying near its nest. "OK, thanks again!" "No problem, Tim. Good luck!" The moa hops back and forth, obviously agitated. [ACTION] examine moa

The trail leaves the clearing to both north and south. A folded sheet of what looks like notebook paper lies wedged up against a tree root at the edge of the clearing. A small dinosaur similar to the one you saw before stands here. He opens his mouth to let out a tentative hiss. Nagi scampers behind you, curious to see what adventures you have planned next.

She notices you reaching for the map, but apparently she's decided she's had enough of carrying things around for now, as she just watches you calmly. With a sudden lunge, the male oviraptor screeches at Nagi, rearing and skittering back towards the safety of a tree. Nagi makes a noise that sounds suspiciously like a laugh. [ACTION] south

Centered in the valley floor is a large mound of volcanic rock, with a large boulder plugging up a fumarole on top. The surrounding rock is riddled with cracks, crevices, and fissures, and hidden in one of the larger depressions is a very large bird's nest, which doesn't look completely intact. The forest trail leads upslope to both the north and south. A huge flightless bird steps back and forth around her nest in agitation. She looks like she's at least twice your height -- maybe three times! She can't be anything but a nesting moa. Nagi saunters along in your wake, curious to see what you're up to. The moa makes a plaintive crooning sound while bobbing her head at the crevice. [ACTION] turn on radio

The GPS is forgotten as Tony veers abruptly and sprints to Dina's side. Something very like a battle ensues, quick jabs of the dinos' heads as they peck at each other almost faster than you can track. Dina seems to win the fight, pinning Tony down and chirruping at him before releasing him to stand again. From there they move into some sort of complicated mating dance. From the intensity of their concentration, it seems almost everything else in the world takes second place to the performance.

[ACTION] northeast [STATE] Animal Trail The ground cover has been pushed aside by passing animals just enough to make this weaving trail the path of least resistance. There is a very tall kauri tree here, its thick roots snaking in and out of the ground. You can hear swiftly running water from somewhere off to the north. To the southwest you can see the forest lighten as it thins out, and the trail forks here, continuing to both the northeast and the north. The two dinosaurs are engaged in an intricate and extensive mating dance. Tony is strutting in spirals around Dina, demonstrating his fitness and virility. Unfortunately, Tony keeps turning to glare at the nearby Nagi (who seems to be fascinated with this behavior) and in consequence Dina appears less than impressed by the performance. Nagi scampers behind you, curious to see what adventures you have planned next. Suddenly, Nagi makes a lunge toward the GPS, but you snatch it away before she can get it away from you. Tony and Dina continue their flirtation, although the presence of a bored and mischievous Nagi keeps their mating dance from taking their full attention. [ACTION] examine gps

[ACTION] north [STATE] Armed with your map and the powered GPS, you strike out into the deeper forest and head north, hoping the station is where Eruera thinks it is. Unfortunately, after just a few short minutes of travel, you hit a wall. Literally. Extending as far as you can see to the east and west is what must be about a twenty-foot volcanic ridge, the remnant of some long-ago eruption. You spend an hour or so scouting it out, trying to find a climbable spot, and eventually you find a place where the stone has crumbled and left a steep defile that you could probably scramble up. The problem is that there's an obstacle in the way -- a large, bony-headed dinosaur that is rubbing itself energetically against the broken rocks, trying to contort itself to reach a particular spot on its back. Please press SPACE to continue. Deep Forest The breeze blowing the tops of the thickly-clustered kauri makes the few flashes of light dance and whirl around you. The trail is all but lost here. A tall, sheer, charcoal-gray ridge stretches as far as you can see from the east to the west. Standing alone in the shadow of the stone ridge is a huge animal. Its giant, bony head and squat, powerful body mark it immediately as a notoceratops mori -- the largest species of dinosaur in Aotearoa, and therefore the biggest dinosaur in the world! It's hanging around near a steep defile in the rock wall, rubbing against it like it's desperate. It notes your presence without reaction, obviously completely unthreatened by your presence.

Your heart pounds as you get close to the twitching beast, but finally you're in range. You reach upwards with the stick, toward where you've deduced the itchy spot must be. It seems that you've guessed correctly, as the huge beast immediately flops down on the ground and tilts its back towards you to improve the angle.

You whirl around to see who it could be and end up with a rifle barrel pressed into your stomach by a tall, brown-haired man in jungle camouflage. "Just stay right there, boy," the man says. "You speak English?" He plucks the radio out of your hands and looks at it briefly, noting the identifying markings on it. "Working with the Conservation Service, eh? I don't know where you came from, but you aren't going to be going back to tell them about us." He flicks one hand at the dinosaur without taking his eyes off you, and several other men in similar clothing move around you toward Fred, who lumbers to its feet, far too slow to avoid capture. Or so it seems. One of the men raises what looks like another rifle and points it at the beast, but at the last moment Nagi rushes from the undergrowth and hurtles onto him, scrambling up his back before leaping to the lower branches of a nearby tree and disappearing again. The man jerks as he pulls the trigger, and a tranquilizer dart goes wide, flying into the forest in a high arc. Fred surges to its feet, bellows, and crashes off through the forest as the leader curses. With a curt gesture, he motions for the men to return and tie you up instead. "Those bloody pests! Well, at least we know that big dino's still around here. It won't escape us for long. In the meantime, you can take its spot in the cages." He smiles. "You never know when a Conservation Service hostage might come in handy." The man's rifle butt whips up towards the side of your head, and you see a blinding, red flash of pain, followed by blackness. Please press SPACE to continue.

The boat leaps forward, throwing water into the sky and pushing a huge wake out to the sides as you rocket out into the bay, leaving the poacher on shore with no shot but wild ones. You can feel a power -- strong mana surrounding you with destiny, and you know somehow that his shots will lack all potency against you. Nagi scampers forward and leaps onto your shoulder, dripping seawater and chattering in ecstasy as you slew the craft towards the south. You know how it's going to be -- you'll make it back to Eruera, pick him up, and head for the closest Conservation Service coastal watch station. You know it, and as the air and sea rush past you, you seem to see the little Maori boy off on the horizon, smiling his wild, triumphant smile. You can feel his presence all the way as you roar down to the familiar shore where Eruera waits for you, waving and laughing in amazement, ready to hear your tale and leave this coast with you to find the station and rescue and, with luck, some justice. *** The End *** In that game you scored 12 out of a possible 12, in 457 turns.
