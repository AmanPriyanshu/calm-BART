[STATE]  If you're going to start talking to MAGIC FISH, you may as well just chat with your THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG. [ACTION] parley with bag [STATE]  You while away the hours, chatting with your THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG, as you have so many times. But this time, something happens that never has before: a SPIRIT rises from the careworn canvas, and bids you follow ... into a long, swirling void ... (press a key when ready) You find yourself in an idyllic village. In the distance, craftsmen work great LOOMS, producing swaths of what you know as THESKIAN CANVAS. The air here is sweet, and the citizens are rosy-cheeked, healthy, and cheerful. They welcome you with BELGIAN THESKIAN WAFFLES and THESKIAN BRUSSELS SPROUTS. The SPIRIT leads you through the streets. "I have seen lately, barbarian, that you are pondering the nature of your trusty THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG ... I am part of that nature, so I brought you here, to satisfy your thirst for wisdom." "This," he says, with a sweeping gesture, "is the town of DUFFEL (ANTWERP, BELGIUM) where traditional woolen-canvas fabrics are produced for the entire galaxy ... including the THESKIAN merchant ports." He smiles a sad smile. "Of course, I speak of the past, before our galaxy fell to ruin ... but it is the past that concerns us right now." "Your BAG," he says, "began here, on those distant LOOMS, before you were born. The fabric was shipped offworld, where THESKIAN LUGGAGE ARTISANS forged a mighty and capacious DUFFEL. Its first owner, a SPACEFARER, carried it to your world of VANTH, where he bedded your MOTHER in a night of revelry somewhere near the realm of the IRON DWARF KING." Rather unecessarily, you think, he summons a magic HOLOGRAM of these events. Narrating the HOLOGRAM, he continues: "It was a night of fiery and tender passions, with your FATHER passed out in a STABLE nearby. The SPACEFARER gave the DUFFEL to your MOTHER, saying that if a child might spring from their intense and repeated coupling (or those joinings that might produce children, for as you can see there was much variety), that the child should be granted his useful BAG, that he might know the gifts of a mighty SPACEFARER." The SPIRIT looks you in the eye. "You, of course, are that child." At this point, the HOLOGRAM is a series of embarassing naked-baby pictures, most of which also feature the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG. "So you see, that is how THESKIAN DUFFEL BAGS came to be on VANTH, and why they are so valued. They are gifts from the stars, and your BAG, dear barbarian, is more than that ... it is your heritage." "I tell you this because the spirit of BELGIUM lives on in your BAG! We have no patience for despots like the SLAVER KING! Indeed, our fair land was ruled by conquerors for EIGHTEEN CENTURIES. The Romans, the Franks, the Austrians, the Burgundians and more." His voice takes on a deep, proud timbre. "But no more, barbarian.

Defeat the SLAVER KING!" ... and then you feel yourself awaken, as if from a deep sleep. (press a key when ready) [ACTION] look
[STATE]  You while away the hours, chatting with your THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG, as you have so many times. But this time, something happens that never has before: a SPIRIT rises from the careworn canvas, and bids you follow ... into a long, swirling void ... (press a key when ready) You find yourself in an idyllic village. In the distance, craftsmen work great LOOMS, producing swaths of what you know as THESKIAN CANVAS. The air here is sweet, and the citizens are rosy-cheeked, healthy, and cheerful. They welcome you with BELGIAN THESKIAN WAFFLES and THESKIAN BRUSSELS SPROUTS. The SPIRIT leads you through the streets. "I have seen lately, barbarian, that you are pondering the nature of your trusty THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG ... I am part of that nature, so I brought you here, to satisfy your thirst for wisdom." "This," he says, with a sweeping gesture, "is the town of DUFFEL (ANTWERP, BELGIUM) where traditional woolen-canvas fabrics are produced for the entire galaxy ... including the THESKIAN merchant ports." He smiles a sad smile. "Of course, I speak of the past, before our galaxy fell to ruin ... but it is the past that concerns us right now." "Your BAG," he says, "began here, on those distant LOOMS, before you were born. The fabric was shipped offworld, where THESKIAN LUGGAGE ARTISANS forged a mighty and capacious DUFFEL. Its first owner, a SPACEFARER, carried it to your world of VANTH, where he bedded your MOTHER in a night of revelry somewhere near the realm of the IRON DWARF KING." Rather unecessarily, you think, he summons a magic HOLOGRAM of these events. Narrating the HOLOGRAM, he continues: "It was a night of fiery and tender passions, with your FATHER passed out in a STABLE nearby. The SPACEFARER gave the DUFFEL to your MOTHER, saying that if a child might spring from their intense and repeated coupling (or those joinings that might produce children, for as you can see there was much variety), that the child should be granted his useful BAG, that he might know the gifts of a mighty SPACEFARER." The SPIRIT looks you in the eye. "You, of course, are that child." At this point, the HOLOGRAM is a series of embarassing naked-baby pictures, most of which also feature the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG. "So you see, that is how THESKIAN DUFFEL BAGS came to be on VANTH, and why they are so valued. They are gifts from the stars, and your BAG, dear barbarian, is more than that ... it is your heritage." "I tell you this because the spirit of BELGIUM lives on in your BAG! We have no patience for despots like the SLAVER KING! Indeed, our fair land was ruled by conquerors for EIGHTEEN CENTURIES. The Romans, the Franks, the Austrians, the Burgundians and more." His voice takes on a deep, proud timbre. "But no more, barbarian. BELGIUM is a parliamentary democracy, producing wheat, fruits and sugar beets alongside our fine metal products and glassware ... and our tourist industry is not the mere joke that the 'Monty Python' would have you believe! Oh no. We are a lovely realm, and perhaps some day you may quest here ..." "But for now, barbarian, know ye TRUTH. Do your DUFFEL BAG proud, fine warrior! Defeat the SLAVER KING!" ... and then you feel yourself awaken, as if from a deep sleep.

[ACTION] use axe on gunwar [STATE]  You extend the BLACK HOLE METAL AXE toward the old peg-leg DWARF, and he REGARDS it at first with polite interest, believing that you are simply showing it off to him. "Ah, yes, a very fine AXE you have there, barbarian ..." But when he realizes you are making an offer, he looks at the AXE again. "BLACK HOLE ... METAL!" he cries, and then he literally cries, taking it into his arms and sobbing a mess of tears onto his bristly black beard. "Lad, have ye any idea how many YEARS ... how many horrors I endured ... Was it THRANG? Did that foul old mustache of a KLENGON tell ye?" The old DWARF collects himself, obviously a bit embarrassed by his display of emotion, but you have sympathy. You, too, feel a great swelling of joy in your heart when you behold an implement of wanton destruction. It is as it must be, for you are a Warrior, and GUNWAR is, too (of perhaps half your Level). Satisfied that you have done a good deed, you turn to leave GUNWAR with the AXE for some privacy, but the DWARF doesn't let you go ... "Lad, please. Wait. I've something ... I think ... I think I've something to tell ye. To ... to show ye." The DWARF begins removing his clothing, and you quickly avert your eyes to let him know that this kind of thanking is not necessary. "No, lad. Look. Look." You peer between your fingers, and see what the DWARF is speaking of. Beneath his old coat of CHAINMAIL, beneath his jerkin, his chest is carved with a thousand old DWARVISH RUNES, seared into flesh with heat and blade. You read not these old letters, but you have heard they have powers of magic. GUNWAR smiles. "Lad, for years I was a Warrior, of perhaps half your Level, and I quested for a BLACK HOLE METAL AXE. It consumed my life, took some of me friends into the grave, and in a dungeon near the AMAZON FREEHOLD of RAKARR, it took me leg." You nod, grimly, in respect. "But lad, I didn't rest. I knew I could never be a Warrior of any real worth again, not with my movements so limited ... So I studied hard to one day SERVE a Warrior ... to become a companion to a worthy death-dealer of ... of perhaps twice my level. I studied to be a healer, son. I can heal you as fast as magic with my herbs! And," he says, pointing to the RUNES, "I had meself RUNE-CARVED, so that if the Warrior I serve may one day choose to wield me in his hand, I do double damage." There is silence for a while, broken only by the distant scream of gulls, and the damp sloshing of the waves on the hull of the PIRATE SHIP. The DWARF gets up his nerve and asks "Can I? Can we? Will ye be my Warrior, lad? I'd be honored to be at your side, helping as I can with the bringin' of death once more. I feel it's my destiny as a healer." And a great friendship is made.

The SUCCUBUS BEE GIRL WITCH QUEEN is defeated! The haze of PSYCHIC CONFUSION fades immediately from your mind, and your keen barbarian instincts return in full! Looking now at the sensuous naked creature on the floor, you see her now for what she is ... a delectable, but thoroughly malevolent BEE GIRL. And not just any BEE GIRL, but a BEE GIRL QUEEN who is part SUCCUBUS DEMON. Those foes are most terrible that cannot be fought fairly, and this one clouded you with PSI POWERS and ASSAILED you with hell-born magic! You free the DELICATE DOXY from her bonds, and she kicks the remains of the BEE GIRL into a convenient chute hidden beneath a fur rug. You hear a distant splash. "It leads beneath the DOCKS to the SEA OF GREAT PERIL," she explains. "Some of my customers are MERMAIDS." You smile at the thought, and then frown, puzzling over the logistical complications. Then you shrug, for such matters are beyond the ken of an upland barbarian. VESSA smiles a very warm smile indeed. "Barbarian ... you came here on business. Shall we?" You pick up the LOST POEMS OF SUTOK from the bed where the demoness had tossed it, and offer it politely to the DELICATE DOXY. (press a key when ready) VESSA smiles a little when she sees you've offered a book ... then her eyes widen when she sees the title. She seems genuinely stunned. "Barbarian!" she says, clearly holding back tears. "SUTOK is the poet of every DOXY'S soul, and it was his verses that led me to my path. I have never been offered such sensitive payment. You truly do see me for who I am, and it moves me." She smiles a wicked, wanton smile. "You will be rewarded for your wisdom, barbarian, with my most inventive pleasures ..." ... Many hours (and many inventive pleasures, and a number of spontaneous recitations) later, VESSA THE DELICATE DOXY sprawls naked across your chest, quietly reading her new book, misty-eyed and dewy with satisfaction. After a time, she speaks: "That demonic BEE GIRL was no random encounter," the DOXY muses. "The BEE GIRLS of the mountains have become bolder of late, and I'm convinced that the SLAVER KING himself is encouraging them, to pacify the dissent at the edges of his realm." She rolls over, and smiles prettily ... "in fact, I know it for certain, because the SLAVER KING has become one of my clients, and he sleeps so very soundly when I'm finished with him that I've been able to see a few scrolls here and there ..." She sees the astonishment on your features and smiles, pleased with herself. "Oh, it's true that none outside the CASTLE have seen the SLAVER KING, and it remains so. He doesn't venture here to the DARK ALLEYWAY; I'm summoned to perform in the THRONE ROOM. And when His Majesty is sated, I wander, and I listen to the talk of servants, and I learn much." She lowers her voice cautiously, but her eyes are filled with happy mischief. "I've learned of a very secret treasure chamber beneath the central hall of the CASTLE ... a treasure that the SLAVER KING hides because he FEARS what it could do to him. I know not yet what this treasure is, but I do know that the fixtures of the CASTLE itself are they key to unlocking it: there is a combination, in FOUR stages ..." Her smile flickers and fades. "I know not the first two. But the second two I know: SEIZE the prized IVORY TAPESTRY, and then REGARD yourself in the MIRROR. This will open the way to the secret chamber. I hope to know more soon." She reaches into her hair. "In the meantime, barbarian, you have saved my life, and for that I owe you much that I cannot repay." She extends her hand to you, and in it lay the RUBY NEEDLE she showed you before. "The WARLOCK'S gift to me is now my gift to you, barbarian. I know not if the magic he spoke of is truth, but if it is magic, you should have it, to work your will against the SLAVER KING." She places it in your hand, and you tuck it idly into your THESKIAN DUFFLE BAG, which hangs at your side even when you are otherwise naked and occupied in lusty pursuits. The DOXY stretches out on the blankets, and looks at you over her shoulder. "Let me ply my trade with you some more, barbarian. For some time I have tasted the injustice of the SLAVER KING, and now that I have tasted ... well, now that I have witnessed his arrogant fury in person, I am eager for distractions from the memories, and eager for renewed enthusiasm for your certain victory." Many hours (and etc) later, you emerge from the DOXY'S chambers, sated and well-pleased, and scented with jasmine and feminine ardour. (press a key when ready) DARK ALLEYWAY Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air and freedom of the open country. Buildings lean against one another, far above your head, and RATS scurry around the base of a large BARREL. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill. Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices. You hear a distant crackle, as if through the ELECTRIC ETHER, a sizzling note of hate! [ACTION] repose

Someone would have to hold you underwater for HALF A THRAMOK to have any hopes of drowning you! Good, eh?" You consider this, and nod. And for a time, XAKANDA teaches you this useful art. (press a key when ready) ABANDONED QUARRY This vast pit stands in the shadow of the snow-capped mountains to the east. It was here that the great stones were quarried to build the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, and the walls of the nearby harbor town. The site is long-abandoned, or so it's told ... But you hear a riotous and happy din DOWN in the GRAVEL PIT. ... As XAKANDA departs back to the GRAVEL PIT OF ROGUES, he salutes you and says "We are fortunate to have you here in this realm, barbarian. Return to fight me again soon; I think you will find I can hold out a bit longer against you, now that we have learned from each other!" You hear a distant clank of metal.

From here, however, it runs east to an ABANDONED QUARRY, and west into the pine-woods north of the CASTLE. You hear a distant crackle, as if through the ELECTRIC ETHER, a sizzling note of hate!

Look. Look." You peer between your fingers, and see what the DWARF is speaking of. Beneath his old coat of CHAINMAIL, beneath his jerkin, his chest is carved with a thousand old DWARVISH RUNES, seared into flesh with heat and blade. You read not these old letters, but you have heard they have powers of magic. GUNWAR smiles. "Lad, for years I was a Warrior, of perhaps half your Level, and I quested for a BLACK HOLE METAL AXE. It consumed my life, took some of me friends into the grave, and in a dungeon near the AMAZON FREEHOLD of RAKARR, it took me leg." You nod, grimly, in respect. "But lad, I didn't rest.

So I studied hard to one day SERVE a Warrior ... to become a companion to a worthy death-dealer of ... of perhaps twice my level. I studied to be a healer, son.

And," he says, pointing to the RUNES, "I had meself RUNE-CARVED, so that if the Warrior I serve may one day choose to wield me in his hand, I do double damage." There is silence for a while, broken only by the distant scream of gulls, and the damp sloshing of the waves on the hull of the PIRATE SHIP. The DWARF gets up his nerve and asks "Can I? Can we? Will ye be my Warrior, lad? I'd be honored to be at your side, helping as I can with the bringin' of death once more. I feel it's my destiny as a healer." And a great friendship is made.

One old PIRATE steps forward and squints at the DWARF, and then at you. "Arr! Don't tell me ye'll be takin' GUNWAR aways from us fer good! Never was there a finer deck-swabber than old GUN, here." GUNWAR smiles. "I'll just be travelin' a bit here and there. Maybe for a short while, maybe a long one. Ye never know." "Ar," the old PIRATE agrees. Some of the other PIRATES shove the corpse of the MORGOM into the SEA. After the splash, one says to the other "Best to send that beastie to Davey Jones right away." "Aye," says the other.

Satisfied that you understand, the MASTER GLADIATOR returns the gesture, and starts back toward the GRAVEL PIT OF ROGUES. (press a key when ready) ABANDONED QUARRY This vast pit stands in the shadow of the snow-capped mountains to the east. It was here that the great stones were quarried to build the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, and the walls of the nearby harbor town. The site is long-abandoned, or so it's told ... But you hear a riotous and happy din DOWN in the GRAVEL PIT. GUNWAR is nearby, scratching a phantom itch on his peg-leg. ... As the MASTER GLADIATOR departs back to the GRAVEL PIT OF ROGUES, he salutes you and says "We are fortunate to have you here in this realm, barbarian. Return soon, to fight me again!" You wonder, for a moment, if the SLAVER KING could ever be defeated by a mortal barbarian such as you.

She peers at you with sudden suspicion, her eyes probing into your thoughts. "Of course, the old prophecy is well-known," she says, "and I see that VESSA THE DELICATE DOXY isn't the only one who has taken an interest in your cause." You can feel her peering within your mind, and her expression is one of both amusement and disgust. "VESSA THE DELICATE DOXY believes you are some master political strategist, the poor girl. I suppose it would be kindness to let her continue believing. It gives her a fire, and an energy that pleases me. But she is very intelligent, VESSA ... I do wonder what about you could blind her so. I wouldn't think her to have such an obvious weakness for simple fitness and savagery, but I suppose, at my age, I should be surprised by nothing." She REGARDS you quietly for a moment. "Your cranium is filled with meat, my friend, and not even the finest cuts." You nod grimly, thinking that this PSI-WITCH reminds you of VESSA a little, with all this prattling.

She sits up on the bed, has a good stretch, then collapses back against you, laughing. "The most unusual development of late has been the amazing work of PROFESSOR MEGARIAN ..." Noticing the look in your eye, she adds "No need to be shy about it, my stallion, my charger, my Haragornian thoroughbred ... the PROFESSOR knows he can confide in fellow disciples of your revolutionary movement." You pause to consider this, and nod, because it means little. "He is a man of very powerful SCIENCE," she muses. "He has been working on methods to send objects backward in time, so that they could be found and used by those living in the distant past, or even preserved in hidden locations until otherwise needed. Isn't that fascinating?" You admire how her naked stomach moves when she squirms in excitement. "Oh, and he sent this for you," she says, handing you a CRIMSON POTION. "He says to save it for your battle with the SLAVER KING, and to waste it not. I told him that there's no need to instruct a man such as you; you will always do what's right."

The noise of the BATTLE has brought the entire REALM, it seems, to witness the outcome. (press a key when ready) Your friend the ROBODROID arrives, leading a rag-tag company of his fellow mechanical men, each armed with weapons they've fashioned from found scrap, and from each others' bodies! "There," says the ROBODROID calmly, pointing toward HIS MAJESTY. "Kill it." While his manner is cold, you think you can almost sense the inner rage of the VOLTAIC WRAITH which crackles in his robotic heart. With your mechanical ally in the lead, the ROBODROIDS begin to ASSAIL the SLAVER KING with a terrifying hail of gunfire, lances of energy, loosed ROCKETS, even a few volleys of STEEL ARROWS. The mighty ATOMIC DINOSAUR is bloodied and battered by the assault, but sweeps the ROBODROIDS aside with a lashing of his tail, and fuses them into slag with his RADIO-PHASIC BREATH FIRE. You are pleasantly surprised to see the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA stride forward from the crowd, with GINA THE VIRGIN SACRIFICE at his side (still naked and gleaming with ANOINTING OIL, but now armed with a pair of BROOMHANDLE MAUSERS holstered in her only "clothing" - a low-slung leather GUN-BELT). Raising the GLADIUS SWORD you gave him high, the ACOLYTE hails you. "Greetings, barbarian! With the SLAVER KING doomed to die, I no longer need to sacrifice GINA, and we can now prepare to be married, instead!" GINA blushes prettily (all over, you notice) and opens fire on the SLAVER KING, as her beloved ACOLYTE charges to engage in melee. Sadly, the SLAVER KING vanquishes them both, knocking GINA into the side of a stone pillar with an unpleasant cracking noise, and carving into the ACOLYTE with his light blade. The blade must have destroyed the TRAGA PRIEST utterly, because only his empty robes flutter to the floor. Crying "for the GLADIATORS!" and waving all three arms madly, VON DARTH THE SLY charges out of the throng, carving into the SLAVER KING'S foot repeatedly with his machete. The SLAVER KING crushes him into a wet balloon of blood and flesh with the other foot. There is a great FLUTTERING from the air and a great SLITHERING upon the ground, as deadly BEASTS enter the fray ... OWLS and EAGLES and PTERANODONS striking from the air, mighty SERPENTS and SPIDERS on the ground, and leading their charge, your beast-friend ADAM the GRIZZLY, roaring with a ferocity he never displayed to you in the wild. Most of the animals are slain quickly by the SLAVER KING, but the flood continues for some time before he can CRUSH or BURN them all. ADAM himself fights to the last, until he too, is left still and bloody on the cold flagstone floor. The mighty THRANG strides in, and lands several good blows before he is fried to a column of pure ASH by the ATOMIC EXHALE of the SLAVER KING. The ash whips into the breeze like a solemn dust-devil in epitaph, and you resolve to later sprinkle some of the ashes at the GRAVEYARD where his KLENGON ancestors rest. There is a fresh roar as a surge of SLAVES charges into the room, obviously released by FOUL EMMA the GLADIATOR FRANKENSTEIN. She leads the charge with tears in her eyes, and two other FRANKENSTEINS - unmistakably her own MOTHER and FATHER - charge with her. The wave of angry SLAVES and the thumping ire of FRANKENSTEIN STRENGTH is enough to topple the SLAVER KING, who falls backward into his own THRONE, crushing it into a forest of splinters! He rights himself with difficulty as weapons pelt him from all directions, but ultimately sweeps all the SLAVES aside, and knocks the FRANKENSTEINS into the shadowy corners of the room, where you hear the unpleasant crunch of bone and flesh against stone. Emma's faint voices reaches your ears: "Me ... love you, barbarian ..." and then there is only silence. There is a RESOUNDING SCREAM, echoing the battle glory of the APE SULTANS, as the great prince XAKANDA THE APE swings down from the shadows on a chandelier rope! The SLAVER KING bellows with hate as the mighty PLANETARY APE Warrior lands on his neck, and begins flailing deadly force with his TRIPLE-BLUTARCH! The ATOMIC DINOSAUR puts his claws to the side of his head, trying to grasp his assailant, and thrashes across the THRONE ROOM in rage! Finally there is an almost-imperceptible squish ... and the SLAVER KING returns to his proud stance, relieved like a normal man who hath crushed a mosquito. The SLAVER KING has little time to repose in his glory, however, as a lance of powerful ENERGIES suddenly wracks his gigantic rubbery form! There is grim laughter from the shadows, where a collection of glowing orange lights and silhouette resolves itself into the form of the MASTER GLADIATOR, unleashing his OWN BODY'S ENERGIES through his GRAVITY WHIPS. The MASTER GLADIATOR regards you quietly with a respectful nod, and then shouts to the SLAVER KING: "Know this, foul ATOMIC MONARCH! We of your realm are no longer your subjects! We of your realm are no longer your machines! We of your realm follow this barbarian to freedom! And our freedom is your DEATH ... and mine." With that, the eyes of the MASTER GLADIATOR glow like twin suns, and the lights on his CYABORG BODY coruscate rapidly, and then there is a heavy wave of EXPLOSIVE FORCE and a flood of blinding light, as the MASTER GLADIATOR unleashes the core of his own LIFE-FORCE in terrifying explosive power. The SLAVER KING bellows in pain, and flies into the air, crashing against the far wall in a shower of cracking masonry and dust. The entire THRONE ROOM begins to shudder, and great blocks of STONE fall from the shadowy heights, many of them impacting the SKULL of the SLAVER KING. ... who, slowly and with obvious annoyance, rises to his feet once more.
