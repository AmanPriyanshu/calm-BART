However, the wide concrete-lined chasm leading down into the ground is a clear indication that this clearing was, at least initially, the result of human labor. The opening is square, with a series of cement steps leading down to the south, ending at a metal-framed doorway.

[STATE] Base Entrance At first glance, this might look like a normal clearing in the brush. Tall grass fills in the open space between the taller vegetation, broken only by a path leading northwest.  However, the wide concrete-lined chasm leading down into the ground is a clear indication that this clearing was, at least initially, the result of human labor. The opening is square, with a series of cement steps leading down to the south, ending at a metal-framed doorway.

Scraggly brush and thickets wave slowly in the glow of your flashlight.  The rustling of branches is the only sound you hear; the area seems eerily devoid of any other noise, even crickets.

Hidden Path This is the end of a very convoluted and twisted path through several hundred feet of frighteningly thorny briar patch.  The track is extremely difficult to see, especially at night, and you know you never would have found your way without help.  It heads back into the thicket to your northeast, the only footpath leading from this small open field among the brambles.  In the middle of the small clearing is a square metal structure, about two feet long on each side and protruding a couple of inches from the ground.  This box is topped by a metal grating held on by rusty latches. Iona is standing close beside you.  She smiles broadly. Like an unexpected cool breeze cutting through a stifling desert heat, pure and innocent emotions roll over you from the little girl.  You feel curiosity and loneliness mixed with confusion and fear. Your Geiger counter chitters quietly. [ACTION] iona, follow me

The helmet you keep tucked safely within your survival pack.  Moving as quickly as you can, you rush from the base in search of shelter.  When you come across a series of cliffs you waste no time in taking refuge behind them.  And not a moment too soon.  The sky erupts in dazzling light, followed quickly by thunderous shockwave. A brilliant mushroom cloud rises up over the location of the research facility as its reactor goes critical.  The two of you spend several hours in the shadow, then make your way towards the awaiting city of Arcadia. [Your score has just gone up by 1 point.] The return trip takes slightly longer than the first leg of the journey, though you soon find yourself gazing upon the Cyclopean structures of your home city.  The guards scrutinize yourself and young Iona, but within no time you find yourself once again walking Arcadia's decaying streets. South Gate The high cement wall of Arcadia stretches as far as you can see to the east and west.  Directly south of you, at the end of the street, lies the massive gate that leads out of the city and into the wasteland. This entrance stays guarded at all times; the familiar shapes of armor-clad Enforcers are visible in the lookout posts above and the squat bunkers on either side the street.  Howe Street draws a dark path in the opposite direction, further into the city. Iona is standing close beside you.  She smiles broadly.
