The driver had an enraged look about him, which is lame.

I say 'pile' but I am more of a deceptively disorganised assemblage.

I figured this was the best chance I'd ever get, so I let go of my perch. I'm less than half the weight of this car, but my impact on the frame nearly crushed it. Luckily there was enough momentum left to carry us both over the side, and bingo! We are falling. My exit's coming up any second, but I should have time for one voicemail. The dude, however, is still screaming. "Shut up man," I croak. "I'm trying to hear this." And then he tells me to get out of *his* car. "It's my car now, pal! Look around." One look out his windshield and he's forgotten me in favour of the water rushing up to greet us. Which reminds me that I missed my jumpoff! I spring up, way up, and out, but it's just too late, and I am dunked in the river less than *10 metres* from the island dump's shoreline. My circuits are shorting.

I seized upon this as my chance to bolt, from the bedroom (which had been relocated to the garage) into my car. The driveway had become just a cracked assemblage of tar floes, but there was still enough traction for me to burn rubber and rocket over that sombrero's rim.

[STATE] Which, backward, the rear window, or the back seats? [ACTION] examine backward [STATE] One thousand eyes are staring down at me from behind. Everyone's walking with arms extended in a trance.

They pushed my car right off the edge of the overpass! I kept honking and tried to put it in gear, but no luck. It's not the longest fall, but long enough. Unsure what else to do, I punch a final blast out of the horn and then commence impact. The horn sticks and blares on, heralding my mutilation in this road-crumpled, flaming wreck. I am about to commit my remaining resources to the process of bleeding out all over the road, when I hear footsteps. Here *they* come again. It's the horn! They travel great distances to the sound.

So. Tired. Do you find it gaseous in here? I should crack a window. What do you think would happen if I stepped outside? Don't worry. I'm kidding. Ha ha. I am too old.

Finally, the giant mouth opens wide, looking almost sad, and with a voice like chains pulled through a pipe, intones: "ROBOTS OBEY WHAT THE CHILDREN SAY." And then the robot giggles. Or no, there *was* a giggle, but it was a child's. It must have come from the giant playroom's giant intercom. There is another sound from that intercom -- something faint. Something odd. But my car radio is still on: I'd have to turn it off, or listen harder. But I am out of time for curiosities. "Throw it again!" comes the child's voice. And the robot does just that. *** YOU HAVE LOST *** Freefall (in the falling car) I am in my car, which is not bad. But my car that I am in is in freefall, which is a kind of bad.

The dashboard is blinking some kind of a warning light, and there's an audio alert, but I'd rather hear the song -- I love this song. Earth radio is the best. Not that there is any other radio; at least, not since I destroyed all other life on the moon for being so annoying. It's a long story, but seriously they deserved it. The next time the Earthlings came by rocket to the moon... I was the only living creature there. I made sure they didn't spot me. I was a longtime listener of course, and had definite plans to visit, but only a monkey'd bet his ass on a can covered in tin foil. I wanted to arrive in style, so I started on my own rig in '73. Just finished yesterday. If you can spot a slight resemblance to a '57 Chevy with warp drive, it's intentional. (Had a little trouble with the theory part, so the nacelles are decorative -- for now.) Anyway the point is: Earth, here I come! Watched from orbit for a while, but that's just dull. Would *Jim Kirk* watch from orbit? No, so let's get dirty: I have started my descent. My retro rockets just fired. I am stoked! How do I look? Does my slime glisten? There's a bacterial comb in the glove box next to the grav gun.

Oh, I dabbled in reality, but as it turns out, the universe sucks, so I vowed to destroy it. But you can't, from inside. There is a very old legend on my world, about an exit ramp from the actual universe. I know -- it sounds superstitious, even to me (and I've been honouring the road gods for a thousand years). They say you have to ride the most snarled cloverleafs in the galaxy to get there. We're talking round-the-clock rush hour through centuries worth of interlooping overpasses and curves. Most just laugh this story off, but they don't have my passion. I actually looked for it. I actually found it. It wasn't easy: I had to buy the deed to the property from a realtor on his deathbed. "Have no fear," he said. "You will be killed right away." I thought that was honest at least, so I paid the man and proceeded to kiss the girl from Venus, for science (or more specifically, for the superweapon intel she had stored on her glandtop).

[STATE] No question about it: the void is much improved over its former self. Oh, I dabbled in reality, but as it turns out, the universe sucks, so I vowed to destroy it. But you can't, from inside. There is a very old legend on my world, about an exit ramp from the actual universe. I know -- it sounds superstitious, even to me (and I've been honouring the road gods for a thousand years). They say you have to ride the most snarled cloverleafs in the galaxy to get there. We're talking round-the-clock rush hour through centuries worth of interlooping overpasses and curves. Most just laugh this story off, but they don't have my passion. I actually looked for it. I actually found it. It wasn't easy: I had to buy the deed to the property from a realtor on his deathbed. "Have no fear," he said. "You will be killed right away." I thought that was honest at least, so I paid the man and proceeded to kiss the girl from Venus, for science (or more specifically, for the superweapon intel she had stored on her glandtop).

The other regulars pay no attention to the standoff at the bar. After all, it's a Tuesday. [ACTION] examine dick
[STATE] Must be Tuesday. Same bar, same crowd, except this week its Dick who has stumbled up to you, the one side of his face looking like a sledgehammer had its way with him. "Hey!" he growls, shoving your shoulder. "Hey! I'm talking to you!" He leans down, his breath fuming with anger and booze. He points at the bruise. "Last week... Aren't you the guy..." He points at his bruise again. "Aren't you the guy who hit me in the eye?" Yep. It's Tuesday. And like every Tuesday, you've got one move to keep this guy from hitting you in the eye. Fingertips: Aren't You The Guy... An Interactive Barroom Brawl by Michael D. Hilborn  Bar The local dive, home to local ruffians, including yourself. You're at your usual spot along the counter, and everyone else is in their usual spot, except for Dick whose breath continues to grace your face in an alcoholic fog. "I'm telling ya," Dick slurs at you. "All ya need to do is say yes, no, or point at the person who hit me." He fists creak as they clench. The other regulars pay no attention to the standoff at the bar. After all, it's a Tuesday. [ACTION] examine dick [STATE] True to his name, that's all you can say. You avoid him like the plague, especially since he believes you fleeced him of several thousand dollars, which you did--but he'll never be able to prove it. Regardless, he'll come after you with any chance he gets. "If yer not gonna say anything," Dick growls, then punches you dead in the face. *** Oh, well... There's always next Tuesday. *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command? [ACTION] point at cedric

"I'll take care of him," he rumbles, but then he returns his glare to you. "I'll come for you, next." Then he's off, hollering at the top of his lungs, preparing to wrap his hands around Cedric's neck. Dick has no chance. Cedric quickly wraps Dick's neck in a scissor lock and within moments, Dick passes out. Cedric stands, dusts himself off, and determining that there is no reason to continue the fight (especially since Dick has been knocked cold), he calmly returns to his seat. And just as quickly as it started, the brawl ends with Dick strewn across the floor. You turn back to your drink, happy to note that the bartender, Butler, has returned. "Another Tuesday, sir?" he asks, looking over the carnage while cleaning a glass. "Another Tuesday," you agree. "Another drink, sir?" You agree to that, too. *** You weren't the guy who got hit in the eye. *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command? [ACTION] point at aric
