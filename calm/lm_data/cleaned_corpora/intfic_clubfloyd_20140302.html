The fire started after she cut the phone lines, and the house burned to the ground.  Her sister's voice was higher-pitched than she had ever heard it - "My god, Roselle, what were you thinking? Whatever were you thinking?" She'd been thinking, it would be so easy to make sure your awful boss never calls you again on a weekend.  She'd been thinking, all it takes is scissors.  She'd been thinking, I have scissors. The cargo pants had giant pockets, and the scissors were still in her pocket.  If she slipped, they would go straight into her thigh. She didn't slip, or even move.  She stood quietly, instead, and listened to her sister, and watched the scorched rubble smoke softly.
