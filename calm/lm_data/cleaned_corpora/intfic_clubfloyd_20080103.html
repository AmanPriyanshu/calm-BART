You follow the sand-strewn brick beach path for the last time, your thoughts a jumble of pleasant memories and angst-filled anticipation. The past week has been a formless, blissful oasis of peace in your otherwise hectic, demanding life.

This short liberty has given you an unexpected sense of perspective on your life.  You've decided that you hate your job.  Though the realization came as no surprise, you were slightly shocked to discover exactly how much you hate your job.  It's not so much the work itself, as the way it's slowly, subtly insinuated itself into your soul.  It fills your thoughts and subverts your energies.  You feel you haven't created anything decent in months, possibly even years. In fact, you're of half a mind to quit.  You've got enough cash in the bank for an extended vacation, and with your skills, finding work will never be an issue.  You could even dedicate some time to pursuing your creative interests.  The only real obstacles are your own inertia and an overblown sense of loyalty that goes unreciprocated anyway.

The octagonal floor is made of unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing. Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.  A number of wooden benches sit along the north face of the pavilion. The snack bar must be what the sign on the stairs was pointing to. Your stomach rumbles again at the thought of food.

[ACTION] buy peanuts [STATE] You clear your throat to get the vendor's attention before asking, "Pardon, could I have some peanuts?"  "Oh, sure," says the vendor.  "I think I've got a few left...  yup, you're in luck.  I'm closing up for the night.  Another few minutes and I woulda tossed 'em."  He takes a pot holder from beneath the counter and uses it to grab a wireframe sieve resting in the boiler.  He bends over the boiler, and as he does, a small steel key slides out of his shirt pocket and falls into the bubbling water.  Using the sieve, he scoops up the bobbing peanuts.  He waits a moment while the sieve drains, and then dumps the peanuts into a brown paper sack.  You dig a dollar out of your pocket and hand it over, and he in turn hands you the sack of peanuts. Apparently, he hasn't noticed his missing key. The vendor sings a few lines of "Yellow Submarine" as he wipes down the counter. [ACTION] eat peanuts

[ACTION] eat peanuts [STATE] This southern delicacy is still something of an oddity to you.  Some locals actually eat the entire peanut, husk and all.  Never one to pass up a new experience, you pluck a peanut from the sack and pop it into your mouth.  The husk crunches soggily between your teeth, revealing the pulpy fruit inside.  You queazily suspect that a large bug would share the same texture.  But despite that...  it doesn't taste bad.  In fact, boiled, the peanuts taste a lot like black eyed peas.  You try another, this time removing the husk.  Yes, it's quite tasty, so you eat a few more.  They're so rich though, that it doesn't take many at all to quell your hunger.  Thankfully, your stomach has stopped its rumbling, and there are still plenty of peanuts left in the sack. The vendor bends down and slams a cupboard somewhere behind the counter. Suddenly, the vendor pulls a white plastic bucket from beneath the counter.  To your surprise, he spills it out over the railing before locking it away again.  "Ah, just about done," he says to no one in particular.  "Just have to dump the peanut water and I'm outta here." He grabs the sieve from the boiler and sets it on the counter.  "Hey, would you lend me a hand here?  I'd really appreciate it." (You sense that the vendor is waiting for a 'Yes' or 'No' answer.)  > [ACTION] yes

With your help, the vendor lifts the boiler pan off its foundation and muscles it to the railing.  He calls out, "Anybody down there?"  In an aside to you he says "Don't worry, we only toss out stuff that's edible.  It all gets eaten by the birds and the crabs. Everything else goes to the dump or gets recycled."  He turns back to the railing and, having received no response from below, yells "Ok, boiling water coming down!"  and leads you in tipping out the boiler. The boiling water cascades down into the sand, filling the air with billowing clouds of steam.  Then, the vendor sets the empty boiling pan back on its base and folds down the lid.  He reaches beneath the counter and withdraws a sturdy looking clamp, which he uses to fix the lid in place.  "Welp, that's it for me.  Thanks much for the help. See ya!" With that, the vendor steps out from behind the counter and sets his feet toward the center of the pavilion to the north. [ACTION] look

You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner. An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack. The old man jerks and then begins reeling in line furiously. Apparently he's had a bite.  The battle between man and nature begins! He lets out a bit of line, giving his catch some play, and then resumes reeling.  The struggle continues until, at last, the line goes slack.  The old man reels and reels, peering over the railing with anticipation until his catch is revealed to be... a shrimp.  He glares with disgust at it for a moment before removing it from his line and tossing it over his shoulder, where it lands at your feet.  He then expertly ties a new lure and recasts.

He glares with disgust at it for a moment before removing it from his line and tossing it over his shoulder, where it lands at your feet.  He then expertly ties a new lure and recasts.

The stones were unloaded on the shores of Savannah, where the ships picked up cotton and other commodities.  Since the stones were freely available, many Savannahians began using them as building material.  These particular stones, as regular as they are, probably came over in a military ship, which would have required precisely weighted ballast in its hold.

It's some sort of huge, scaly reptile, basking on its swollen belly in the evening light.  Lying flat against its sides are a pair of batlike wings that sprout from a ridged, bony spine.  The spine curves down and around, ending in a massive, coiled tail.  Two plump hind legs sprawl out in back, while a pair of short, stubby arms lies crossed beneath an angular head full of sharp looking teeth. You note that certain parts of the creature, including its spine, claws, eyes, and teeth consist of carefully placed sea shells.  The shells give the creature an illusory realism.  Curiously, there is an empty cavity in the creature's beak that looks as if it might once have held a shell. All in all, the dragon seems surprisingly realistic, as if it had recently clawed its way out of the sand to warm itself beneath the bright sun. You move towards the dragon...  but halt with a sudden flash of insight.  In your mind, you picture someone spending hours digging up and piling the sand, pushing it into rough form, carefully smoothing the curves and contours, detailing the fingers and face, collecting shells for the dorsal ridge...  You carefully back away, and as you do, it almost seems that one of the dragon's heavy lidded eyes opens, and favors you with a long, lazy wink. A thin crest of white foam glides up the beach and covers your toes before gently receding. Which shell do you mean, the clam shell, or the mussel shell? The dragon sculpture is not a container. You try setting the clam shell into the cavity.  Nothing happens, and somehow, it just doesn't feel right.  Disappointed, you reclaim the clam shell. You try setting the mussel shell into the cavity.  Nothing happens, and somehow, it just doesn't feel right.  Disappointed, you reclaim the mussel shell. It's a shallow cavity about the size of your two cupped palms, in both depth and circumference.  There's nothing in it. [ACTION] examine head

To the north, tall dunes flank the base of the pavilion, blocking your way. Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery sand. A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still visible. Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air with hungry shrieks. A new gull, apparently a stranger to the flock, flies low over the feeding grounds and sends the other gulls into a screaming rage. [ACTION] east

[STATE] It's too bulky too pick up and carry around, but you could easily push it in any direction you wanted to go. [ACTION] push aluminum canister east [STATE] You give the aluminum recycling canister a tentative shove.  It proves to be surprisingly light.  In fact, you're able to raise it an inch or two above the ground and slide it out into the sand beneath the pavilion. Under Pavilion You're in a low space beneath the pavilion, which is supported by massive cement pylons.  Two metal pipes extrude from the cement above you and bend east to follow the pier.  The beach lies east through an opening in the dunes, and an open wire mesh gate leads to a small storage area to the west. You see an aluminum recycling canister here. [ACTION] again

[ACTION] again [STATE] You grab hold of the canister and slide it east, over the dry sand. You've made it almost to the far end of the pavilion when you trip over your own feet, sending the canister over on its side.  You look up to find that the canister has begun rolling down the slope towards the ocean.  You chase after it, but it's picking up speed.  You redouble your efforts to catch it, and it looks like you just... might...  make it...  Splash!  The canister goes into the water and starts drifting out to sea.  It shrinks into the distance between the long row of pylons, becoming smaller and smaller.  Soon, the canister has drifted out of sight. Damp Sand, Beneath Pier You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting pylons.  The pylons lead east like a subterranean avenue.  A pair of pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to the north or south. You see a crab shell, lying in the sand. A flash of light catches your eyes.  It seems to have originated from the pipes running overhead. [ACTION] west

Two plump hind legs sprawl out in back, while a pair of short, stubby arms lies crossed beneath an angular head full of sharp looking teeth.

From below, you can hear the fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf. A speck of sunlight glints off a ship lying far off on the eastern horizon. It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the small shelter. End of Pier The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.

Resting on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

You rise, the canopy dropping away behind you.  Your mind and vision expand as you ascend high into the atmosphere, above even the towering hotels.  The world contracts beneath you.  It's as if you've become some huge bubble, and your entire surface acts like a lens, magnifying, intensifying.  Everything seems almost surreally beautiful.  The sun wavers a hair's breadth above the horizon like a fat, ripe, blood orange.  Its rays speed diagonally towards you through streamers of cloud turned to pink cotton candy.  The sweeping rays hazily rake the fertile wetlands that lie beyond the shore. Broad swathes of grassy emerald are bordered by wheat colored marshes. Green and gold are divided by snake-like ribbons of shadow and light, where twisting streams alternately capture and reflect the light.  The rays fade lazily to the east, smudging the sky with shades of peach and rose and lilac and cool, steely blue.  A pale moon hangs like a plump sand dollar in the milky blue eastern sky.  And beyond, the stars... Suddenly, the vision recedes as quickly as it came upon you, sending you plummeting like a falling star to the earth's welcoming grace. You find yourself in yourself again, standing on the wood shingled canopy in the cool air of the early evening light. You stand and consider the experience for a while.  You'd nearly forgotten how to appreciate the beauty of everyday life.  It's enough to get you to thinking about your job again, and how it consumes so much time that you can't even enjoy common miracles such as this. You're wavering.  "Maybe I'm being hasty," is what you're now thinking.  Sure, a couple of fancy displays now and then make life more interesting, but is that enough reason to quit your job?

[STATE] As you gaze into the distant sky, you feel an incredible sensation, as if your body were a balloon in the process of being inflated.  You rise, the canopy dropping away behind you.  Your mind and vision expand as you ascend high into the atmosphere, above even the towering hotels.  The world contracts beneath you.  It's as if you've become some huge bubble, and your entire surface acts like a lens, magnifying, intensifying.  Everything seems almost surreally beautiful.  The sun wavers a hair's breadth above the horizon like a fat, ripe, blood orange.  Its rays speed diagonally towards you through streamers of cloud turned to pink cotton candy.  The sweeping rays hazily rake the fertile wetlands that lie beyond the shore. Broad swathes of grassy emerald are bordered by wheat colored marshes. Green and gold are divided by snake-like ribbons of shadow and light, where twisting streams alternately capture and reflect the light.  The rays fade lazily to the east, smudging the sky with shades of peach and rose and lilac and cool, steely blue.  A pale moon hangs like a plump sand dollar in the milky blue eastern sky.  And beyond, the stars... Suddenly, the vision recedes as quickly as it came upon you, sending you plummeting like a falling star to the earth's welcoming grace. You find yourself in yourself again, standing on the wood shingled canopy in the cool air of the early evening light. You stand and consider the experience for a while.  You'd nearly forgotten how to appreciate the beauty of everyday life.  It's enough to get you to thinking about your job again, and how it consumes so much time that you can't even enjoy common miracles such as this. You're wavering.  "Maybe I'm being hasty," is what you're now thinking.  Sure, a couple of fancy displays now and then make life more interesting, but is that enough reason to quit your job?  And what about your employers?  What'll they do without you?  You're still going to need a few more convincing arguments.

To the north, tall dunes flank the base of the pavilion, blocking your way. Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery sand. A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still visible. You see a treasure map and a shingle, lying in the sand. Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air with hungry shrieks. Two gulls break off from the main flock to fight over a choice morsel. A third flies over to investigate, and soon all three fly squawking away over the beach.

You try to sit up, but your arms are somehow pinned behind you.  In fact, it feels like they're tied down. You can even feel a coarse rope tied roughly around you.  Your eyes are gummed shut, but you force them open and take in your surroundings with blurred vision. You can't even begin to imagine how, but you've come to be lying in some sort of underground grotto.  The walls and ceiling are of rough stone, and water drips from the ceiling and puddles around you on the stony floor.  A cool breeze on your back suggests that the cavern extends to some distance behind you.  Nearby, a thin, sandy shore descends towards a sheltered inlet.

To the north, tall dunes flank the base of the pavilion, blocking your way. Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery sand. A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still visible. Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air with hungry shrieks. A snowy white gull apparently materializes right in the middle of the flock, cranes its neck as if searching for someone, and then dematerializes. [ACTION] east [STATE] The warm dry sand gives way to cool wet sand as you move closer to the shoreline. Damp Sand, South of Pier To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that extends from the pavilion.  The small castle you found here earlier has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into the larger castle. A tiny crab rushes from an invisible hole by your feet and scuttles away, quickly disappearing into another, equally invisible hole. [ACTION] east

[STATE] You toss the shrimp to the ground. A slight gust of wind sends eddies of sand swirling over the brick path. [ACTION] southeast [STATE] You skip along the wooden boardwalk to the beach, evoking a strong memory of the carefree summer days of your childhood. Dry Sand, South of Pier The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the base of the pavilion, blocking your way. Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery sand. A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still visible. Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air with hungry shrieks. Two gulls break off from the main flock to fight over a choice morsel. A third flies over to investigate, and soon all three fly squawking away over the beach. The warm dry sand gives way to cool wet sand as you move closer to the shoreline. Damp Sand, South of Pier To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that extends from the pavilion.  The small castle you found here earlier has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into the larger castle. The surf glides up to meet you as you approach the water, a cool shock against your warm skin. Shallow Water, South of Pier You're up to your knees in the gently surging tide.  It flows up onto the beach to the west and grows deeper to the east.  To the north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the pier. You launch yourself towards deeper water, skimming along for a few yards before coming to a stop. Deep Water, South of Pier, (treading water) There's nothing but endless ocean to the east.  Shallower waters beckon to the west.  The long cement pier finally comes to an end to the north of you, its supporting pylons disappearing into the murky depths.

[ACTION] jump off pier [STATE] The old man watches with flinty eyes as you set the brick on the railing and then climb over, coming to rest on the outside of the railing with your heels hanging over open air.  Suddenly, you realize you won't be able to turn around while carrying the brick.  You swallow and resign yourself to going off backwards.  A trembling spasm flits through your calves as you raise the brick. You count three, take a deep breath, and...  jump!  You fall fast and hit the water, hard, with your face, throwing spray everywhere.  The weight of the brick drags you down fast, faster.  You fall down and down alongside an enormous dropping slope, and the water turns cold around you while the pressure pierces your ears with shards of glass.  You throw back your head and howl in pain, losing most of your air in a glittering swarm of bubbles, and still you fall into darkness.  But below you is a speck of light, and even as you fall from the sunlight, this new light gives you hope.  It grows as the sun diminishes, and though it gives off no warmth, it cheers you slightly.  The barbed pain in your ears subsides.  You fall further and further, and finally, you hit bottom with a dull thud that raises a cloud of mud.  When the mud clears you find you've somehow lost track of the brick. Underwater, (drifting) You're at the bottom of a long, precipitous slope.  The cold and pressure are intense.  Judging by the dim light, you must be many fathoms below the surface. It's astonishing that you made it this deep without any diving equipment.  An enticing beam of light in these frigid, sub-arctic depths has resolved into...  the huge staring eye of an enormous octopus! Your lungs are almost empty of air after your long descent.

A trembling spasm flits through your calves as you raise the brick. You count three, take a deep breath, and...  jump!  You fall fast and hit the water, hard, with your face, throwing spray everywhere.  The weight of the brick drags you down fast, faster.  You fall down and down alongside an enormous dropping slope, and the water turns cold around you while the pressure pierces your ears with shards of glass.  You throw back your head and howl in pain, losing most of your air in a glittering swarm of bubbles, and still you fall into darkness.  But below you is a speck of light, and even as you fall from the sunlight, this new light gives you hope.  It grows as the sun diminishes, and though it gives off no warmth, it cheers you slightly.  The barbed pain in your ears subsides.  You fall further and further, and finally, you hit bottom with a dull thud that raises a cloud of mud.  When the mud clears you find you've somehow lost track of the brick. Underwater, (drifting) You're at the bottom of a long, precipitous slope.  The cold and pressure are intense.  Judging by the dim light, you must be many fathoms below the surface. It's astonishing that you made it this deep without any diving equipment.  An enticing beam of light in these frigid, sub-arctic depths has resolved into...  the huge staring eye of an enormous octopus! Your lungs are almost empty of air after your long descent.  You can already feel burning tendrils of pain spreading through your chest. [ACTION] examine octopus [STATE] You examine the 'octopus' more closely.  You can see now that it's nothing more than a rusty old diving bell.  But it really does look like an enormous octopus stretching up from the ocean floor.  Its rusting, barnacle encrusted head is supported by four thin, stilted tentacles which disappear into the swirling sands.  Completing the illusion are a pair of plate sized eyes, which stare at you with shining intensity while producing the light that lured you so deep. A few small bubbles escape your lips, glittering in the light as they rise towards the surface. The burning pain in your lungs grows stronger, triggering the first feelings of panic and setting your heart racing. [ACTION] enter bell

The stygian depths have parted to permit a single powerful beam of sunlight, which illuminates a scene of startling beauty.  The ocean floor beyond the portholes is grown over with a coral reef that swarms with a kaleidoscopic variety of life.  Brain coral sprout like fungi, their convoluted folds home to tiny, salmon colored shrimp.  Larger crustaceans are visible here and there, hiding in shadow as they wait for their unwary prey.  Schools of fish swarm in great prismatic clouds, their pale bellies reflecting tiny bursts of light as they wheel and twirl.  Fluted ivory branches climb surface ward, reaching like grasping fingers for the silver fish that dart among them.  And presiding over all like the kings of yore are great purple sea fans, which wave majestically in the currents as if bestowing grace upon their radiant subjects. Discovering all this at such great depth and so far north is nothing short of miraculous.  You'd almost forgotten the pleasant thrill of finding beauty in unexpected places.  It starts you thinking about work again, in particular the way it dulls your interest in searching for wonder. You're feeling skittish.  "Could I really do this?"  is what you're asking yourself.  You've unconsciously begun tallying your savings. You've even got the beginnings of a resignation letter going in the back of your mind.  If only you had a couple more arguments to put your mind at rest. You notice that the mud beneath the coral seems oddly level.  In fact, one patch in particular doesn't look like mud at all.

[ACTION] dance [STATE] You set your feet to the dance hall floor and follow the steps you learned from the old, sunken diagram.  You begin with clumsy feet, but become more proficient as you rehearse.  As you dance around the pavilion, a strange thing happens.  Ghostly figures begin to join you - a small few at first, but growing in number.  You can see them becoming more substantial as they spin and whirl in their gossamer wing tips and slippers.  Petticoats twirl about you as the ladies wearing them prance and pirouette, lead by gentlemen in high collared, pin striped suits.  You glance around at the revelers surrounding you, only to notice that the pavilion has undergone a transformation of its own.  Where once everything was dull grey cement, you now find rough wooden planks painted with a variety of dance step diagrams.  The pavilion has also shrunken considerably. Colorful banners light up the otherwise gloomy rafters.  Your examination is interrupted when someone taps your shoulder.  You whirl to find a partner inviting you to join in the revelry.  Following your new partner's lead, you swing and sway to the spirited notes of a lively jazz band.  The music plays on for what seems like hours, but you never tire, even when the sun descends in the west.  As the sky grows dark, attendants set out paper lanterns which bring a fiery glow to the festivities.  You continue to dance through song after song, frequently trading partners until you're giddy and slicked with sweat.  Eventually, though, the ball begins to wind down.

The musicians go too, soon followed by the attendants with their paper lanterns. In a few bare moments everyone is gone, and you notice that the pavilion has reverted back to grey cement.

What an incredible reminder of the joy of expression!  In fact, it gets you to thinking about work again, particularly the way it crushes all your creative output and turns it into predigested pap for unintelligent clients. You're feeling excited.

[STATE] You set your feet to the dance hall floor and follow the steps you learned from the old, sunken diagram.  You begin with clumsy feet, but become more proficient as you rehearse.  As you dance around the pavilion, a strange thing happens.  Ghostly figures begin to join you - a small few at first, but growing in number.  You can see them becoming more substantial as they spin and whirl in their gossamer wing tips and slippers.  Petticoats twirl about you as the ladies wearing them prance and pirouette, lead by gentlemen in high collared, pin striped suits.  You glance around at the revelers surrounding you, only to notice that the pavilion has undergone a transformation of its own.  Where once everything was dull grey cement, you now find rough wooden planks painted with a variety of dance step diagrams.  The pavilion has also shrunken considerably. Colorful banners light up the otherwise gloomy rafters.  Your examination is interrupted when someone taps your shoulder.  You whirl to find a partner inviting you to join in the revelry.  Following your new partner's lead, you swing and sway to the spirited notes of a lively jazz band.  The music plays on for what seems like hours, but you never tire, even when the sun descends in the west.  As the sky grows dark, attendants set out paper lanterns which bring a fiery glow to the festivities.  You continue to dance through song after song, frequently trading partners until you're giddy and slicked with sweat.  Eventually, though, the ball begins to wind down.  The musicians belt out one final, powerful number.  Afterwards, they pack away their instruments.

He takes each fish in turn from the pail and deftly decapitates it, slits it lengthwise, strips out the viscera, and sweeps the offal into the sea.  Once done, he wraps each fish in newspaper and tosses them into a burlap sack at his feet.

[STATE] It looks like an ordinary boiled crab to me. [ACTION] eat crab [STATE] You crack the shell open without hesitation.  The crab's juices dribble out over your chin as you suck out the sweet meat.  Mmm!  You couldn't have gotten better at Savannah's finest restaurant.  Oh, if only you had some butter and a bit of lemon juice!  Once you finish, you discard the broken bits of shell and wipe your greasy hands off on your damp shorts. A fat, grey gull swoops past you, lands momentarily on the nearby railing, and then launches itself back into the air. [ACTION] north

The octagonal floor is made of unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing. Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier. There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice your height. [ACTION] west

It's a perfect fit, and somehow you can feel the...  rightness...  of it.  A shiver seems to ripple down the dragon's spine, as if presaging some magical awakening.  The ripple rebounds from the tail and shudders back up the spine, growing in force and velocity until it disappears into the base of the creature's skull.  Then, slowly, lazily, the eyes open as if from a long, restful sleep.  Suddenly the head darts forward, causing you to leap back, fearful of an attack.  But the creature is merely stretching its long, sinuous neck.  Its angular head splits open in a great, toothy yawn that sends you peddling still further back.  Then, it rises up on its plump forelegs and shakes from side to side like a dog throwing off droplets of water.  Stretched and shaken, the creature throws its head skyward and trumpets forth with an elephantine roar that rattles your bones and sends every gull in the vicinity flapping away down the beach.  The creature's wings snap open with a loud crack that echoes out over the water like gunshot. Finally, the great, sandy beast glances around the beach, tightens the muscles of its powerful hind legs, and launches itself into the air. In an instant, it is airborne, beating the air with mighty strokes of its wings.  Its tail whips from side to side as it claws at the air, climbing higher and higher.  It turns to the west, toward the setting sun and the great marshy wetlands.  Soon, it's just a speck against the pastel smudged sky.  Then, gone. Incredible.  You've never believed that there was any real magic in the world, though your heart has always wished otherwise.  Here it is not only proven, but shown to be the result of singular personal vision.  What else but the sculptor's purity of belief in his creation could have brought it to life?  It gets you to thinking about work again, and how infrequently it lets you pursue your own vision. You're feeling resolute.  "That's it.  I'm quitting."  You've made up your mind and thrown caution to the winds.  First thing on Monday, you're going to write your letter of resignation.  You feel exhilaratingly light, as if some constant pressure had been removed. You're sure that this is the right decision. A thin crest of white foam glides up the beach and covers your toes before gently receding. [ACTION] southwest
