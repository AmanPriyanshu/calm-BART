[ACTION] put pill in whiskey
[STATE] Bill Leveritt has been Thom's partner in their architectural firm for as long as you've known Thom.  Bill's thatch of thinning gray hair and round glasses make him look older than his forty-two years.  He tries to dress flamboyantly but often fails, as demonstrated today by his long-sleeved blue oxford shirt.  He's extremely good at what he does, but he is very unassuming; Thom is the talker of the firm.  In one hand he is holding one of his ubiquitous glasses of whiskey. Carl arrives from the west. Bill hands Ash's purse to her.  "Here," he says, "you dropped this." Ashleigh turns an odd shade of red: you can't tell if she's embarassed, mad, or worried.  "Thanks," she finally says. [ACTION] put pill in whiskey [STATE] You can't put anything into the whiskey. With a disgusted shake of his head, Carl moves to the radio and begins calling for help. Ashleigh, on the other hand, watches Bill for a few seconds before moving to him and slapping him for all she's worth.  Bill stops completely: he has no idea how to react. "Listen here, you pompous ass," Ash hisses at him, "none of us are particularly happy right now.  But you're not helping.  Stop it." After a long few seconds of staring, Bill turns and pours himself another whiskey. [ACTION] put pill in whiskey bottle

"I didn't mean to yell at him like that.  It's just...I mean..."  Her sentence trails off. Carl looks at her for almost half a minute, doubt showing on his face. Finally, "I think I'll go check the engines.  Gives me something to do, anyway." [ACTION] look through south window

The helm controls, including the wheel, are mounted on the fore wall, next to a chest-of-drawers which sports a lamp.

Also on the port wall, aft of the entrance, is a small bar.  Across from it is a dinette bench.  Windows are at each of the cardinal directions.  The west entranceway is open, as is the companionway to the north. Sitting on the small bar is a drink tray. Ashleigh is here, standing pensively. Bill is slumped in the dinette bench. Bill hands Ash's purse to her.  "Here," he says, "you dropped this." Ashleigh turns an odd shade of red: you can't tell if she's embarassed, mad, or worried.  "Thanks," she finally says.

Just tell me what hap--" Your speech is cut short by the muzzle of a revolver.  It must be Ashleigh's.  How did he get Ash's gun?  You don't have a lot of time to think about that, however, as Bill interrupts you.  "Shut up!  Just shut up!  I don't have to listen to you!"  Bill is clearly skating over the thin ice of insanity.

"Move over there together!"  All three of you comply. "He wasn't supposed to..."  Bill clears his throat, mopping his face with his left hand.  "Thom was embezzling from our firm.  I would have been bankrupted.  I only found out yesterday.  When I confronted him with it, he laughed at me.  You saw us shouting.  What an idiot I was."  He laughs quietly, but there's an edge of desperation to his laughter. "And when I confronted him with it again, he told me there was no proof.  I showed it to him.  He never was as clever as he thought he was.  He tried to grab it, I shoved him back..."  His eyes dart around the room.  "He wasn't supposed to fall overboard!  It was an accident!" You've been transfixed by the fact that Bill was able to say all that without one "uh" or "ah," but Carl has been inching closer.

You freeze, hoping you've distracted him enough, but knowing that you haven't. Carl decided that now's his best chance, and he jumps towards Bill. Bill jerks back, swinging the revolver around and firing in the same motion. The smell of cordite fills the air as Ashleigh screams.  Carl's eyes widen almost comically, and he staggers back, blood spurting from a newly-formed hole approximately in the middle of his chest.  Bill fires again, then again, more of a reflex action than anything else. You try to grab the gun from Bill, but he backhands you with it. "Shut up, Ashleigh!" he yells at Ash.  Surprisingly, she stops. Bill looks around wildly, then makes a decision.  "Drag him into the stateroom, both of you." "Let me at least get one of the drinks for their wounds," Ash begs of Bill.  He nods slightly, glancing nervously around the forecastle. Ashleigh grabs the whiskey bottle. You take hold of one of Carl's arms; Ashleigh grabs the other, looking distinctly queasy.

He lets out a long, drawn-out scream.  Bill and Ashleigh are shocked into immobility.  You make a grab for Bill's gun, but he still possesses the presence of mind to backhand you viciously with it.

Bill turns and fires in the same motion. The smell of cordite fills the air, and Carl's leap turns into a stumble as the revolver bullet furrows into his left leg.  He lets out a long, drawn-out scream.  Bill and Ashleigh are shocked into immobility.  You make a grab for Bill's gun, but he still possesses the presence of mind to backhand you viciously with it. Bill looks around wildly, then makes a decision.  "Drag him into the stateroom, both of you." "Let me at least get one of the drinks for their wounds," Ash begs of Bill.  He nods slightly, glancing nervously around the forecastle. Ashleigh grabs the whiskey bottle. You take hold of one of Carl's arms; Ashleigh grabs the other, looking distinctly queasy.  The two of you drag Carl into the stateroom, leaving Bill behind to mutter to himself about his nerves and how they need calming. Forward Stateroom Compact yet liveable, the fore stateroom has two v-berths that meet near the nose of the ship.  On the port wall is an open hanging locker, and across from it is the door to the forward head, standing open.  A small ladder to the south leads up to a door. The hanging locker seems to contain a safe. Carl lies here, in shock from the wound to his leg. Ashleigh is sitting beside Carl, tending to his wound.
