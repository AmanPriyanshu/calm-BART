Anyway, today was quite extraordinary: You see, I woke up this morning in the spaceship of some kind of intelligent extraterrestial life form. I was locked up in a cell but luckily I used my wits to get one of them to open the door. He tried to attack me but I used my amazing martial arts skills to kick his, and his 500 friends', ass. Unfortunately one of them snuck on me from behind and sucked my brains out. Some kind of evil computer then decided to kill me if I didn't answer its extremely complicated riddle right... Of course, thanks to my amazing mathematical skills, I did, and after a weird mushroom trip I got my brains planted in this awesome killer robot. This led to an epic fight of me versus an even larger laser-armed gigantic killing machine I easily beat using only a rusty crowbar and a radioactive flashlight. Oh wait, I think I can see the exit over there. I sometimes have the idea that no matter where I go, I always end up there anyway. Yours sincerely, me Please press SPACE to continue.
