"But Aunt Nina, I found a letter from Mom last night saying that you have information about where Mom and Dad are!" "I don't have time to write you a recommendation letter right now, Emily. Let's talk about it after the transfer," she says, her eyes on the transfer chamber controls. "No, Aunt Nina, I said--" "Emily, please!" You lapse into silence rather than continue the fruitless conversation. This is really very odd. Aunt Nina is always a little out of it when she's focused on a procedure, but you've never seen her quite this out of it. Aunt Nina walks over to the containment chamber and starts inspecting it, talking to you all the time. You recognize this behavior -- you and Austin call it her Lecture Mode, and once it starts rolling, it's about as easy to stop as a speeding train. "So, as I'm sure you remember, Emily, these experiments deal with bacteria that I'm convinced are at least 250 million years old. These guys were around millions of years before the first dinosaurs evolved, back when all the continents were in one smushed-together landmass called Pangaea. The bacteria have been trapped in a deposit of salt crystals since that time, and today's procedure is the next step in extracting the bacteria so that we can study them." You can't blast anything until you put the skysuit back on. "People have found living bacteria trapped in salt before," continues Aunt Nina, "but their reports have been rejected because they couldn't prove that the microbes weren't actually contaminants from the lab. This time, though, we've taken extraordinary precautions -- everything has been in a sterile environment from the outset, and we've washed the salt crystals with both caustic bleach and acid. Then once the crystals are in the transfer chamber, we'll use sterilized equipment to drill inside them." [ACTION] talk to nina

Once a sealed container has been placed within the transfer chamber, the pale green switch activates a sterile transfer to the desired receptacle. The switch is currently in the OFF position. "Of course, there is a danger that the radiation emitted by nearby rocks might have damaged the DNA of this bacteria sometime during its 250 million year journey, but without a metric for comparison, it may be hard to tell. In any case, it certainly raises interesting questions about the limits of life. Knowing that bacteria can survive for this long in such an unforgiving environment has even begun to make me wonder whether it's possible that they can hop from one planet to another -- who knows, perhaps these microbes have an extraterrestrial origin?"

The blast strikes home between two armor-plates, and the creature screams in pain and rage. The beast reels back for a moment, temporarily stunned by the cumulative electrical power you've directed at it. KER-POW! You extend your hand, and a sizzling bolt of bright blue electricity arcs between you and the monster. The bolt hits thick green hide, creating an impressive scorch mark but failing to do much actual damage. [ACTION] blast eyes
[STATE] At your mental command, fog swirls around the monster. However, the creature is so mind-staggeringly large that by the time the fog covers his length, it has thinned into wisps of vapor that blow away at the monster's next roar. WHAMMO! This time you're too slow to avoid the claw, and pain razors through you as the point penetrates your calf. As you sail towards the library, you notice that the suit has sealed itself over the wound and applied pressure to stop the bleeding. Then you're slamming into the roof, and everything goes black for just a moment. You can't take much more of this. Roof of the Library Everything is fading in and out, and you can't seem to focus. Roof of the Library Everything is fading in and out, and you can't seem to focus. Roof of the Library Everything is fading in and out, and you can't seem to focus. Your vision is swimming, and you're too dazed to do anything but lie still for a moment. You shake your head to clear out the last few cobwebs, and your vision snaps back into focus. Roof of the Library You have found yourself on the roof of the library. The heating and air-conditioning ducts have buckled and broken from the force of the quake, and the tarpaper beneath you feels hot and slippery. Girding yourself for battle once more, you fly back to the scene of the rampage. At the Monster's Knees You are at the monster's knees, and you're starting to get a sense of what it must be like to be an insect. The massive legs dominate the landscape like twin towers, one rising out of a hole in the bio building's roof while the other decimates the sidewalk with stomps and scratches. You've got the monster's attention now, and its huge claw is hurtling towards you! You soar higher, up to the monster's midsection. At the Monster's Belly Floating in the air, eye level with the belly of the beast, it's hard not to imagine that belly containing the remains of anybody foolish enough to aggravate this creature. The monster's head looms menacingly above you, and its spiky legs descend like barbed towers to the ground. The behemoth misses you, but that only seems to make it more determined. Another claw is coming at you like the Mortality Express. Wind streaming through your hair, you zoom upwards. At the Monster's Head The creature's close-set yellow eyes burn with anger as you hover in front of its face. From here, the thing's fetid breath washes over you like a tidal wave of swamp gas, and its roars are louder than jet engines. The ground seems very far below you now. Thanks to your fancy flying, you've managed to avoid getting swatted, but there's no time to celebrate, because another claw is coming towards you! At your mental command, fog swirls around the monster's eyes, silently engulfing them in thick, grey vapor. The creature squeals in confusion as it loses its sight. The creature is flying into a frenzy, clutching its eyes with one hand and lashing out randomly with the other. Its feet stomp in fury, leveling trees and cars. Better take this beast down, and fast.

[ACTION] blast eyes [STATE] The monster is thrashing about wildly in its blindness, and your lightning bolt misses its eyes. The beast's claws dig deep furrows in the concrete sidewalks. KER-POW! You extend your hand, and a sizzling bolt of bright blue electricity arcs between you and the monster. You make the mistake of looking directly at the lightning, and are blinded for a moment. When your vision clears, the monster seems to be bleeding slightly where you hit it. The creature picks up a stray car and throws it in your general direction. The car misses you, but slams into the side of the library, shaking that building's walls. The monster is wounded now in several places, and a sickly smoke drifts upward from the cauterized spots beneath its armor. [ACTION] blast face

The creature picks up a stray car and throws it in your general direction. The car misses you, but slams into the side of the library, shaking that building's walls. The fog lifts, and the monster's eyes are visible again. The thing is stomping, swinging its arms, and bleating despair at its inability to stop the pain. It reminds you of nothing so much as a boxer, badly beaten and on the ropes. Another parked car crumples beneath the beast's stamping foot; this is sure to be a black day in the history of auto and building insurance.

[ACTION] put balloon in mouth [STATE] The liquid-filled balloon sails into the creature's mouth, causing the beast to swallow reflexively. When the mouth opens again, the liquid-filled balloon is gone. Seeing that the creature has swallowed its medicine, Austin steps back from the head, which drops with an earthshaking CRASH! You both watch the creature intently, as it lifts its head to regard you, not with anger now, but with puzzlement. And then you notice: the creature is shrinking. Its skin thins, wrinkles, deepens from its greenish cast to the rich brown of Aunt Nina's skin. Soon it is only a dazed Aunt Nina before you, naked and shivering. You quickly retrieve your sweatshirt and pants, and Austin helps you put the clothes onto her. She embraces you and your brother in a fierce hug. "Oh Austin, Emily!" she cries. "I remember now! On the same day that Claire and Scott disappeared these... things found me in my lab. They did something to my brain -- wiped out my memory, put all my focus on the experiment. But whatever happened to me just now must have broken their mental constraints." You show her the letter, and she scans it, nodding. "Yes, yes! It's true -- I do have information that I know can help you find your parents. Oh Emily, I'm so sorry I couldn't give it to you before now!" You look over at Austin, and he nods. "You'll have plenty of time to talk to us, Aunt Nina, but what you need right now is rest," he says. Then he gathers her into his powerful arms, and leaps over the stadium wall, heading for home. You're about to fly after him, when you catch sight of a reporter and a camera operator, scrambling through the rubble towards you. "Miss! Wait -- miss!" the reporter shouts, thrusting a microphone into your face. "Can you give us a statement? What happened here? Who are you?" You smile. "Call us Earth and Sky," you say, and then take to the air, flying home faster than any news copter can follow. *** You have saved the day *** Watch for Episode 2 of EARTH AND SKY, coming in 2002 to an IF archive near you! ? On The Fifty Yard Line [Previous turn undone.] Time passes. Austin's muscles are shaking with exertion. "Emily, I can't hold on much longer!" Time passes. "I'm losing it!" cries Austin, and steps back from the head, which drops with an earthshaking CRASH! The creature groans, and Austin shoots a look of pure frustration at you. "Come on, Emily! I can't hold the head up and deliver the antibiotic! Your part isn't difficult, so do it, before this thing wakes up again!" He bends his knees, grips the monster's brow, and hauls the enormous head up again. [ACTION] wait

A mammoth eye flicks open, regarding you with vague hatred. [ACTION] wait
