[STATE] Video Arcade This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op video games. The machines are crowded with half-crazed, stunted humanoids, who pay no attention to you as they satisfy their thirst for electric violence. One machine in the corner appears to be deserted. A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token." [ACTION] put token in machine [STATE] The brass token disappears into the slot. Ding! You hear a pleasant electric chime, and a blinking star appears on the video screen. (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 61 out of 100.)

Hilltop You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Witchville. A tower stands in bleak silhouette against the moonlit sky. It rises a hundred feet above a barren plateau, and is encircled by a deep moat. The only entrances are a closed drawbridge and a dark window near the top.
