Naturally, you aspire to join the largest and most prestigious of organised thieving bodies, the Multi-Dimensional Thieves' Guild. One day you are approached by a tall man wearing a long cloak. His face is hidden in the folds of the hood and his voice is deliberately muffled. Making no introductions, he tells you that your recent activities have been monitored with interest, and offers you a provisional membership in the M-D.T.G. All you have to do is pass a simple test. Since this is a childhood dream come true, you eagerly accept. The test goes like this; you begin in a specially prepared set of rooms, and your only objective is to get out of them. Your prowess as a thief is not in question, however there are other talents to be tested. The rooms are pieces "borrowed" from other universes and magically spliced together to test your ability to deal with rapid changes of scenery, a prerequisite for any work in the Multi-Dimensional Thieves' Guild. A number of useful items have been added to the rooms, to make your test just that much more interesting. Oh, and one more thing. Here's a few basic clues: examine everything you find, read most things, and, above all, think symmetrically.
