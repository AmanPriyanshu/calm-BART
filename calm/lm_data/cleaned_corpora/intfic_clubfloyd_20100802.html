"Au revoir and all that -- should be delighted to see you on the other side, of course --" And he hoists his luggage and starts carefully descending. The ?lev? is a huge, terraced moving walkway that curves and swoops through the heart of Paris. Perhaps not the most efficient mode of transport in the world, but certainly one of the most striking. It's a little reminiscent of an ancient Greek amphitheatre, except that the rows of steps are moving, each a little faster than the one beneath. The only sound is a gentle rumble and the occasional whine from one of the motors. Each step whines at its own distinctive pitch, and the combined effect is oddly musical. Clever baffles divert most of the wind, leaving only a stiff breeze. Perched at the top, you're moving at some twenty kilometres per hour. You're travelling south-east along the Avenue de l'Op?ra, towards the Louvre. And there it is, approaching fast -- Hotel Guiraud! Emma stands looking out over Paris. Emma waves at George.
