Shore  Restaurant Basement You're in the basement of a defunct little bistro in the West 7th neighborhood of Saint Paul.  This is where your cult does most of its culting, on account of how your Aunt Sandy doesn't want any sacrifices in the house, and well, fair enough.  Uncle Stu owns the building, so you're not squatting or anything, but he's kept the place in a state of perpetual Coming Soonedness, so that you all can do your thing here with no interference. As I say, defunct bistro, so the restaurant-type stuff you'd normally find here is mostly gone.  In their place there's a group of guys wearing hooded robes, facing an altar at one end of the chamber. Your Uncle Stu has a lectern in front of him, atop which is a decrepit leather-bound book from which he is chanting.  There's a wooden stair leading to the pantry above and a winged horror slumped in a folding chair in the corner. [First-time players should type ABOUT.

OK, yeah, this is starting to come back to you now.  He scrawls out an Elder Sign in the middle, and then lights a candle on either side of you.  He dips into a bag of, well, it looks like red sand, but is probably something like granulated Shoggoth nightmares.  Wait, no -- the bag is from Petco.  Anyway, he sprinkles that around a bit, then places the printout of the woman and her hairclip in the center, on top of the sign.  He grabs your hands and closes his eyes.

Finally Jeff yells, "Iä! Iä!"  The sand begins to swirl around until it resolves into the form of a street map.  Wow, this is pretty bitchin'.  You can feel power flowing through you. "Barry, get ready!  Watch for the spark!"  At this, the image and the hairclip are consumed in brilliant green flames, accompanied by thick smoke.  The fumes begin to sting your eyes and nose.

You sound a massive, deep blast that reverberates against the walls of the sanctuary.  You keep the blast going, a single piercing note, forcing the air from your lungs until they begin to ache.  You look up, and see the congregation recovering. The horn's blast is drowning out the crystal!  Leah slowly uncurls herself, opens her eyes, and sees you sounding the horn.  She seems oddly calm now, and starts to crawl away. Still you blow, your face turning red, then purple, the same note sounding, shaking the very walls of the temple.  You close your eyes as you expel the last bit of air.  Finally, there's a cracking sound, and a pulse of white light.  The crystal shatters.

Sailboats and canoes dot the lake in front of you.  The air is filled with bird songs and the scent of flowers.  Leah stands to your right, beaming and crying.  Behind you are several dozen guests.  On her side: her parents, family, and friends.  On yours: Sandy, Jeff, and some of the other guys from the cult.  Yeah, the cult is still operating, but it's pretty mellow now.  Fewer human sacrifices, more pancake breakfasts.  Mostly now it's just a way to feel like you're part of something. The rabbi places his hands upon your heads and intones a final prayer. At your feet is a glass, wrapped in a napkin.  The rabbi points to it and nods. [ACTION] smash glass
