More are flooding in through the employee entrance. The generator makes a really loud noise, and it makes everything shake. You can't even think straight. A sudden chill comes over the crowd and their attention focuses more sharply on you. As one, they reach out and begin pulling at your clothes, at your flesh. Little fingers pry your skull open wide and little teeth sink into the rotting remainder of your brain. Your body is laid out flat by many hands, and you become a permanent feast. *** There is no relief. *** In that game you scored 3 out of a possible 4, in 323 turns.
