You dump all the easy stuff in the trash and then begin picking out pieces of paper and post-its one by one, trying to remember what the hell various passwords, phone numbers, and illegible scribbles were supposed to be for. A business card catches your eye, and your breath sticks in your throat. How could you have left that there? You lift it reverently, kiss it. It's hers. Lisa Douglas Graphic Designer Staring into the confident, professional logo she designed for herself, you remember every detail of the day she gave it to you. How her hand brushed yours as everyone was waiting to be seated at the restaurant. The sleek white car she arrived in, and her majestic exit therefrom. Her smile as she handed you the card, suggesting that you call her if you ever needed an icon, or some snazzy buttons for a website. You know she was just being nice - you're pretty sure you could never afford to have someone that good work on one of your projects. Squirreling the card away in a drawer, you get back to work on your desk, thoughts lingering... You finish cleaning your desk. [ACTION] books

Lisa Douglas Graphic Designer Staring into the confident, professional logo she designed for herself, you remember every detail of the day she gave it to you. How her hand brushed yours as everyone was waiting to be seated at the restaurant. The sleek white car she arrived in, and her majestic exit therefrom. Her smile as she handed you the card, suggesting that you call her if you ever needed an icon, or some snazzy buttons for a website. You know she was just being nice - you're pretty sure you could never afford to have someone that good work on one of your projects. Squirreling the card away in a drawer, you get back to work on your desk, thoughts lingering... You finish cleaning your desk. [ACTION] mail

The streets are filled with shocked, bedraggled citizens, so you fit right in. Your mind hasn't even begun to process your place in what happened, but there's a big lump of dread waiting for you to snap out of it. Then the watch starts ticking, and your skin starts burning. No! ## NO! A sob escapes you as you break into a run, trying to get away from people, from what's happening to you. This is not me! you try to scream, but your throat is clogged, and you're already attracting attention, already towering above the other people on the street. You bellow a warning and try not to step on anyone. You wipe tears from your enormous eyes, trying to step lightly, but you know if you stop the helicopters will find you in moments. Rage and fear course through you, and the screams coming up from the ground are unutterably wrenching. Your foot comes down again, carefully avoiding a parked delivery truck, and goes straight through the ground. You trip and topple, and the road gives way where you fall, leaving a giant gash right down the middle of Seventh. You've caved in some kind of subway mainentance tunnel.

Sitting on the edge of the pit, eyes level with the third story of Paul's building, you open your satchel and take out the watch. It's about the size of a dinner plate, and still looks fairly small in your hand. You think you know which one it is. You reach out with your other hand and poke a finger through Paul's window. You lean in, and you can see him turn around. He rushes to the edge of the mess of glass on his floor and stares out at you agape. You hold up his watch, make sure he understands what it is. And then you crush it. And then you shrink. - - - - - Part III: Paul Light Beams Down From Heaven You step up to the window, ignoring the broken glass under your slippers. You shield your eyes against the glare of the sunlight intruding on your normally dimly lit room and look north up Seventh, toward the sirens. You see a black cloud rising above the city. That was your watch. A fragment of your dream comes back to you: turning back the watch, again and again, trying frantically to avert disaster and bring forth the Lisa you desired.

[STATE]  am carrying nothing. [ACTION] examine figurine [STATE] It's a likeness of Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president of the United States. Harrison may not have been one of our more exciting presidents - he's certainly no James K. Polk - but he did do something that no other president has done. Generally speaking, once a president loses re-election, he doesn't bother running again, because everyone knows that no one votes for a loser. But Harrison's economic policies were so monumentally unpopular that the incumbent he defeated in 1888, Grover Cleveland, was actually able to mount a successful challenge to him in 1892. Cleveland is thus considered to be both the 22nd and 24th president. I've always liked that anomaly, and without Harrison's particular blend of win and lame, it wouldn't have happened. Normally it's part of a diorama at a small museum downtown, but someone snuck in and cut one of its arms off the other day, so I took it home to do a little repair work. I suspect that the mystery vandal was my evil twin, but I haven't mentioned this to anyone. [ACTION] examine papers

[ACTION] open coffin
[STATE]  I try to dig, but my hands claw madly against wood, nothing more. *** I have lost my hold on life. *** That was perhaps not the best outcome. Let us see if you can do better, shall we? (Press any key to restart.) Fingertips: I Hear the Wind Blow A one-turn interactive narrative by Jacqueline A. Lott  Written for Apollo 18+20: The IF Tribute Album. Inspired by the writing prompt "I hear the wind blow." First time players may wish to type ABOUT, CREDITS, or HELP. You may contact the author at jacqueline.a.lott@gmail.com Darkness I hear the wind blow.  It sounds as if it's close by, but I can't feel it.  On the contrary, the air seems stale. [ACTION] open coffin [STATE]  I realize that I have but an instant to act.  Despite the weakness of the moment before, I gather strength and beat wildly against the wood. The movement proves too much: my senses become disjointed, my head begins to throb, I gasp for air, and the panic within me begins to increase: the full horror of my situation becomes abhorrently clear. Then, it's almost as if I begin to observe my feelings from outside myself: alarm gives way to surrender which paves the way for peace... Then I sense movement.  A jostling.  And a voice: dreamlike and distant.  "Oh my God, she... I think she may still be alive.  Gerald, help me lift her--I'm not as strong as I used to be.  We've got to get her some help." ** *** I have saved my own life. *** I managed to attract the attention of passersby, who came to my aid. Perhaps I will see justice done. HINT: Even though you've found a winning ending, if you're not certain what just happened (or why you were even in that predicament in the first place), please consider playing again. Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, or QUIT? [ACTION] knock
