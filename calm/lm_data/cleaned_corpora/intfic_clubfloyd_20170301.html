Since the death of Captain Iero, the yonger generation raised by the military has formed a militia and has seized control.  The bridge has been closed off.  Study of the cosmic radiation is being officially terminated, although most research was abandoned long ago. It is my belief that the radiation is intrinsically tied to the anomaly that overtook us, that it may hold the key to our deliverance. A synopsis of the knowledge acquired about the radiation through research and about the circumstances that lead to our present situation follows. The emissions are similar to the cosmic noise left over from the birth of the universe, but more intense and focused in a single vector, as if it were a transmitted signal.  The radiation spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum.  It must also run much deeper than the known spectrum, because dark matter distortions were registered in frequencies corresponding to the emissions. We first discovered the signal emanating from the exact same vector in which the ancient artifact had been travelling before it was lost, originating from an unknown point outside of the galaxy.  This is too vastly improbable to be coincidental.  We do not know what happened to this artifac, which has served as our beacon, leading us to and in this journey in the dark.  Nor do we know the relationship between the artificat and the radiation.  All we know is that when we synchronized our propulsion drives with the frequency of the signal, the stars disappeared from the viewports, and our navigation systems failed. Our propulsion system was functioning until the photon generators were salvaged 8 years ago, but attempts to travel through this void have yielded no results, as there is no frame of reference to determine motion. I expect that this will be the final entry in the mission log.  This file will be added to the bios of the system synchronization network, to be displayed whenever the network is activated.  It is my hope that the next generation will one day renew the study of the emissions, and that our descendents will one day find a way to return to normal space. Good luck, and God speed -- to you and to those whom we left behind. --- Lewis Yuan, Captain of the Galilei and Liason to the Council of Thirteen [....] [ACTION] talk to chronos

Chronos holds his rod vertically in the center of the group, and you notice that outside of your small circle, everything looks distorted and hazy. "I entered through a secret hatch," Chronos says, looking around carefully. "That's the problem with invisibility fields; they make it difficult for you to see, as well," he mutters quietly. He leads you silently along the girders, gunshots crashing around you, until you come to a wall bracket that has been folded down to the floor, revealing a square opening at its base.

He points the meter-long black rod at the door, and then turns one of the dials on it.  A humming sound grows steadily louder, and the aft arch begins to vibrate and tremble, causing the whole room to shake.

"This too will arise again," he mutters, and then turns and enters the tunnel. "Onward!" Your journey through the sealed tunnels is long and dark.  You pass unchallenged, relying on Chronos's knoweldge of the route, until you arrive back in the less clandestine corridors.  Chronos activates an invisiblity field with his rod, but every turn seems to be occupied by Militia Guards.  As you gradually progress toward the Commons, you see increasing signs of chaos. At the Heart of the Godspeed A battle rages in the Commons, concentrated near the aft end.  At this end, people can be seen running from point to point, careful to avoid each other.  The ground is littered with signs of chaos and death. Chronos Han is here.  Chronos holds a meter-long black rod. [ACTION] fore [STATE]  You encounter no one as you pass through the commons.  As you reach the corridor beyond, all is unusually quiet, except for the echoes of the distant chaos. A Corridor Removed from the central passageways of the Godspeed, no more than two travelers could pass with comfortable distance between them.  The walls here are panelled in strips of the unknown alloy of the older parts of the ship, but the homogenous white material of the newer renovations begins just meters down the corridor to aft.  To fore, the corridor narrows further and angles upward in a ramp, leading to the observation dome. Chronos Han is here.  Chronos holds a meter-long black rod. "Here!" Chronos says, rapping on the wall panels with his knucles.  "I believe the entrance corridor leading to the bridge can be found behind this wall." [ACTION] open panel

You prise up the severed panels and toss them aside, raising your laser tool to work on the material underneath. "They've caught us!" Veritas lays a hand on your shoulder, distracting you from your excavations.
