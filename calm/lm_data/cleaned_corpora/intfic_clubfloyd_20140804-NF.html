People often describe it as innate skill, and that's partly it, but it's something more than that; it also, somehow, shields you from the kinds of bad luck that get even the strong and experienced killed. It is not something to be relied upon, given that it makes you neither bulletproof nor inexhaustible, but it's one hell of an edge. For some, the talent manifests in sublime grace, a whirl of dancer's rhythms and brush-stroke arcs. It does not work that way for you.

You met a guy once whose only talent, other than wayfinding itself, was juggling. He could juggle pretty much anything he could lift one-handed, mind you, and had thought of several unexpected applications, but it didn't go all that far. Textual criticism is a good bit more useful, because - like most gifts - it's truly cross-cultural, which means that you can read, say, a pamplet of pornographic 18th-century French political satire, or an oral history of land rights among indigenous Tasmanians, or a zine circulated among otaku in 1980s NorCal high schools, and you will actually grasp all the layers of meaning. Apart from making grad school embarrassingly easy, it's very useful for grappling with the otherwise-incomprehensible peoples that populate odd corners of the ways and worlds - as long as they're literate, or willing to tell you stories.
