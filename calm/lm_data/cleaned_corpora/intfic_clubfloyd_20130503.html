Doorways lead off in two other directions; the east appears to be a kitchen and the north is a living room. There is no upstairs in the house; the entire upper metre or so is filled solid with various forms of algae, to grow oxygen, regulate temperature and recycle waste. In one corner is a stubby yucca tree. You hear someone to the north re-entering the living room, whilst the piping of the bubble sucks water from the toilet. However, he goes no further than the sofa. [ACTION] examine tree
