Lilith was really wonderful and you fell in love at first sight. You were 26 years old when she appeared, and you had already had much experience with women. As the young descendant of one of the richest family in the region, you were the object of desire of all the girls of the territory, who did all that they could to get your attention. To you, one was equal to the other, you continuously changed lovers to gather new experience, thinking only of having as much fun as possible. When Lilith arrived, everything changed. The first time you saw her was at a party thrown by your family to let you meet new people, in the hope that you would eventually meet the woman of your life. She came to the house in the evening, with a cousin whose name you didn't even remember. She was very beautiful and her unusual vivacity fascinated you immediately. The freshness of her appearance made her look very young, but she talked as if she were already highly experienced. When you finally managed to be alone with her, you took her hand for a walk in the woods, where nobody would disturb you. You thought that such an exuberant girl wouldn't have any objections about there in the woods, away from prying eyes. Instead it was her who took you. When you saw her eyes change their colour to red like two rubies and her cuspids become monstrously long fangs, it was too late to go back. However you are grateful to Lilith for not allowing you to run away. You could have never imagined the pleasure you felt when she pierced your neck with her teeth and sucked your blood almost to the last drop. Lilith disappeared right after, but she came back to meet you many other nights, in your house garden or directly in your room, when you would open the window and invite her to come in and drink your blood again. Even she grew fond of you: after drinking your blood for weeks, to prevent your death she decided to give you the dark gift that would turn you into an immortal night wanderer. Then she vanished forever, leaving you to your destiny with the memory of her fiery eyes and eager lips. [ACTION] examine painting

As the young descendant of one of the richest family in the region, you were the object of desire of all the girls of the territory, who did all that they could to get your attention. To you, one was equal to the other, you continuously changed lovers to gather new experience, thinking only of having as much fun as possible. When Lilith arrived, everything changed. The first time you saw her was at a party thrown by your family to let you meet new people, in the hope that you would eventually meet the woman of your life. She came to the house in the evening, with a cousin whose name you didn't even remember. She was very beautiful and her unusual vivacity fascinated you immediately. The freshness of her appearance made her look very young, but she talked as if she were already highly experienced. When you finally managed to be alone with her, you took her hand for a walk in the woods, where nobody would disturb you. You thought that such an exuberant girl wouldn't have any objections about there in the woods, away from prying eyes. Instead it was her who took you. When you saw her eyes change their colour to red like two rubies and her cuspids become monstrously long fangs, it was too late to go back. However you are grateful to Lilith for not allowing you to run away. You could have never imagined the pleasure you felt when she pierced your neck with her teeth and sucked your blood almost to the last drop. Lilith disappeared right after, but she came back to meet you many other nights, in your house garden or directly in your room, when you would open the window and invite her to come in and drink your blood again. Even she grew fond of you: after drinking your blood for weeks, to prevent your death she decided to give you the dark gift that would turn you into an immortal night wanderer. Then she vanished forever, leaving you to your destiny with the memory of her fiery eyes and eager lips. [ACTION] examine stool

They eventually found our hideout. They arrived to the camp in the morning. They were a lot and well-armed, your minions were taken by surprise and they were overpowered and slain in few hours."

"I shouted and shouted with all my breath, while we walked through the tunnel leading to your crypt. But you were sleeping, you couldn't wake up, so they killed you merciless. Now, seeing you alive again is a great joy for me because I'm sure that my death will be revenged together with yours and who did us wrong will die in horrible pain. Maybe, one day, you'll find the way to get me out of this damned place, where there's no escape from suffering and everything burns, burns, buuurns!"

[STATE] This curse should give you the energy you need to overcome the symbols of Good. Praseidimio fluctuates around you, eager to give his contribution to the triumph of evil over good. [ACTION] east [STATE]  Protected by the curse received from Lilith, you easily overcome the white cross painted on the floor and proceed to east, followed by Praseidimio. Corridor Beyond the cross drawn on the floor to impede your passage, there is a narrow corridor that goes from west to east. It connects the bats room with the stone steps that should lead out of your hideout, towards the dark maze of caves that hides its entry. On the floor, the ceiling and the walls, you can see many other magic symbols. They have been drawn to avoid your escape, but their effect on you is nullified by Lilith's curse. Praseidimio is at your side, ready to give his contribution to the triumph of evil over good. The impossibility of seeing your image reflected in a mirror is one of the things that you hate most about your vampire condition. So the gigantic mirror that is in your way towards your freedom, to the east, is a horrible view to you. Your persecutors thought of everything to keep you imprisoned in your own hideout. The mirror is too large to be covered, bypassed or climbed upon, so you have to find a way to destroy it, if you want to leave the hideout. [ACTION] east

[STATE]  The mirror blocks your way. Do you want to ask Praseidimio to help you to break the mirror? (y/n) [ACTION] yes [STATE]  Praseidimio stares at the mirror uncertain. Being near him you see that his image too isn't reflected but he doesn't seem to care about it. Probably a small gesture would be enough for him to break the mirror, as it was for you when you were at the top of your strength. At last, acknowledging that it's a problem too difficult to solve for a vampire in such a bad condition, the demon agrees to grant your wish. He points one of his shapeless excrescences to the mirror and breaks it, scattering its small fragments on the floor. "You've been satisfied" says Praseidimio, before disappearing in a cloud of red smoke. "Now go on with your revenge. And may the red sun of Valmar shine on your dark nights of vampire!"

[STATE]  You play some very sweet music that calms the wolf and makes it fall asleep. [Your score has just gone up by eight points.] [ACTION] east [STATE]  Mountain slope Outside the cave, every sense of yours is assaulted by the garlic flowers planted all around the entrance. A new attempt to block your escape from the mountain bowels, to keep you from making the world your kingdom of terror again. Luckily the mask you are wearing has such a strong smell of blood that it attenuates the stench of garlic, allowing you to stay outside the cave, near the flowers. However, to continue your escape you must find the way to destroy the field which surrounds you. The smell of the garlic field is terrible. [ACTION] burn garlic
[STATE]  Mountain slope Outside the cave, every sense of yours is assaulted by the garlic flowers planted all around the entrance.

Luckily the mask you are wearing has such a strong smell of blood that it attenuates the stench of garlic, allowing you to stay outside the cave, near the flowers. However, to continue your escape you must find the way to destroy the field which surrounds you. The smell of the garlic field is terrible. [ACTION] burn garlic [STATE]  With your rudimentary torch, you set fire to the garlic field. The sight of the flowers burning is wonderful and soon the stink that prevented you from leaving the cave fades away, covered by the acrid smell of the fire and by the scent of your victory which gets closer. Delimited by the scree slope of the mountain, the fire quickly dies after destroying the field. The road to the freedom seems to be clear, but in such a bad condition you can't go far. You're still too weak to turn into a bat and fly away. Moreover, outside your hideout you won't have any protection, because you no longer know anyone that could help you. While you think how to recover your energy, you see a girl arriving from the botton of the slope. She has blonde hair, wears a violet dress and she seems to come towards you, probably drawn by the smoke of the fire. She quickly reaches the charred field, then she notices your presence and stops, uncertain. [Your score has just gone up by nine points.] [ACTION] remove mask

[Your score has just gone up by nine points.] [ACTION] remove mask [STATE]  The girl smiles when you remove the mask and show her your face. Maybe she was waiting for that to cross the charred field and reach you near the cave entrance. "Sir, it's so strange meeting you here in the dead of night" she exclaims, visibly excited. "I'd like to ask you what you are doing here, all alone, and if it was you who set the field on fire, but maybe first all of all you should tell me your name." Do you want to reveal your identity to the girl? (y/n) [ACTION] north
