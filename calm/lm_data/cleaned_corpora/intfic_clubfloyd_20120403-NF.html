This is the situation: For six hours last night, she chatted with a single individual (one oakthorn177).

You watched first with trepidation, then with outright horror, as they spent more and more of their virtual time together. Last night, as you read over her chat log, sifting through the JKs and LOLs, the axe fell: Jane had set up a date with oakthorn177. It's not that you're against your master having romantic attachments - quite the opposite - rather it's the particular character in question. More specificly, it's this character's race and gender -  oakthorn177 is, you see, a male elf. (press any key to continue - press twice for the Too Long; Didn't Read) In recent weeks she has been chatting regularly with this Elvish Prince. They've gone on quests together. You always thought that for Jane - being bisexual - things would be easier, but somehow she's gone and fallen in love with exactly the wrong character class. The crux of the problem is this - there is not a single male elf in all of Realmland, nay in all the vast reaches of the internet, who is not played by a heterosexual woman. Of this simple fact, a thousand forum posts have made you certain. To you, it hardly matters - you just wish Jane would find a nice organic meatbag and settle down - but you try and understand that humans are picky about these things. Perhaps, you reflect, she has been blinded by that Knavish Sorceror, love. In any case, you fear that if your master ever discovers the mistake she has made, her already fragile ego will never recover. Yes, strictly speaking, this goes beyond your professional duties, but these are extraordinary circumstances. Action must be taken.

Andrew Ma likes to listen to the Clash, Journey, and Bob Dylan. Andrew Ma's favorite movies are The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Andrew Ma's favorite books are The Lord of Rings, The Hobbit, and Breakfast of Champions. Andrew Ma's interests include J.R.R. Tolkien, art, and computers. To think that such a perfect match for Jane could have been working in the cubicle next to him for all this time - they even both listen to Journey! More importantly, Andrew's a Tolkien fan. Never before had you considered the idea that Jane's knowledge of the Professor might actually help her in the arts of romance, but now... You imagine the scene: Andrew and Jane, walking through the city park, a few months from now. The sun has just set, and a full moon is peeking over the skyscrapers. They're holding hands. Jane stops, she holds Andrew at arms length. They look in each other's eyes. "Oh, Andrew," says Jane, falling to her knees. "Will you take my one ring?" "Yes!" cries Andrew, eyes glowing. It will be just like that... or at least something along those lines. You take it upon yourself to make sure this happens. A link to the EAST leads to one of Andrew's friends, her cousin Edward.
