[STATE] Balance Room A cramped square room, barely lit by windows above you.  The north and west walls are taken up by tables.  A clock and a light switch are just visible next to the stairs on the south wall.  In the northwest corner is a tiny drain; in the southeast corner are two large wheels, one on the east wall and one on the south wall.  A pile of spheres has claimed part of the east wall beneath the wheel. In the middle of the south wall is a heater. Sitting on the tables are a rucksack and five balances. A man stands bent over the tables, jotting things down in a large notebook. As your footsteps sound on the stairs, the man turns.  He looks you over, one eyebrow quirking in surprise.  "Hello," he says.  "And here I thought I was the last one still around.  I'm Frankie."
