From the log of Professor Pettibone, eminent Victorian Balloonist: Twenty-fourth of February, 1876.  The English Channel. Our Journey begins!  A large crowd gathered this morning in Berkeley Square as we made our final preparations for what is to be one of the most daring expeditions ever undertaken; a journey around the world by balloon.  Our vessel, which I have christened Titania, consists of a strong wicker basket borne aloft by a sealed balloon containing 30,000 cubic feet of hydrogen, an amount which, according to my calculations, should be quite sufficient to carry myself, Mr.  Booby and all of our supplies and equipment.  Mr.  Booby is travelling with me as a last-minute replacement for Doctor Cox, who was suddenly taken ill with a serious case of the dreaded badly-bruised knees just days before the launch.  Dressed in a huge, shapeless overcoat, he cuts rather a strange figure, but I am confident that he will prove to be as good company as his predecessor, and as competent an aeronaut as he claims.  At eleven o'clock, amid cries of "Huzzah!"  I cut the ropes binding the balloon to the earth and we soared aloft on the first leg of our journey... Fourteenth of September, 1876.  Fujian province, China. I began to have my doubts about Mr.  Booby almost as soon as the balloon had made its ascent from Berkeley Square.  The instant we left the earth, Mr.  Booby got into such convulsions of nausea that I began to doubt his credentials as a balloonist, and as a suitable replacement for poor Dr.  Cox, who was suddenly taken ill just days before our take-off.  Though I have expressed to him many times the importance of keeping the weight of the balloon down to a minimum, I am beginning to suspect that Mr.  Booby has, against my wishes, been smuggling souvenirs of our journey into the balloon under that great coat of his.  Only this morning I caught sight of him in a marketplace, haggling over the price of a particularly ugly vase.  He was not exactly a small man even before we set out, and he seems to grow larger and larger as our journey progresses.  There is something about that strange, mis-shapen coat of his that arouses my suspicions. Twenty-sixth of June, 1877.  The Ecuadorian Andes. Our situation is desperate.  A fierce wind from the south-west carries us ever closer to the mouth of an erupting volcano.  If my calculations are correct (and there is no reason to suppose otherwise) we are headed directly for the mouth of Mount Cotopaxi, highest volcano in the Americas!  Our altitude is twelve thousand feet, and in in spite of all my efforts, I am unable to raise the balloon any higher.  I have been forced to throw out all four sandbags, our food and water supplies, our first-aid kit, our compass, variometer and theodolite, and yet still we are too low to safely clear the volcano! In a moment I shall be compelled to throw out this very log-book, along with the pencil I am writing with, and all my outer garments, in a last ditch effort to gain the necessary altitude of twenty thousand feet.  Mr.  Booby assures me that he has disposed of all unnecessary weight, and yet somehow I doubt his veracity.  If there is anything at all concealed beneath that voluminous coat of his, I must find it now and dispose of it over the side of the basket, or we are both doomed! In the basket of a balloon I am in the basket of the balloon, high, though not high enough above the foothills of the Andes.  Directly ahead of us is a glow in the sky; the heavens themselves seem to be ablaze as the wind carries us ever nearer to an erupting volcano!  Attached to the ropes that hold the balloon aloft is a brass altimeter, the one and only piece of aeronautical equipment that has not been sacrificed.  The basket is otherwise quite empty. Hubert Booby stands in the corner of the basket, peering into space. [ACTION] inventory

As I do so each button flies off like a speeding bullet, and finally, with a great rending sound the coat bursts open, spilling a multitude of diverse objects onto the floor of the basket!

For some reason Hubert seems to find this amusing.  He tries to stifle his laughter but it escapes him as a sort of nasal snort.  He bends down to stroke the ears of the St.  Bernard. The equilibrium of a balloon in the air is so sensitive that the loss of an almost insignificant weight can produce a very appreciable displacement.

The equilibrium of a balloon in the air is so sensitive that the loss of an almost insignificant weight can produce a very appreciable displacement.  In this instance, the balloon gains around one hundred feet in altitude. [ACTION] examine altimeter [STATE] The altimeter is currently reading 15,800 feet above sea level.  In order to clear the volcano in safety we must reach an altitude of 20,000 feet! [ACTION] throw lighter

[STATE] I have never studied music, but the noise that emits from the instrument when I place it to my lips is not entirely unpleasant. Hubert, who is clutching his ears, seems to be of a different opinion. [ACTION] throw it [STATE] Having no further use for it, I cast the trombone out of the basket. Hubert merely sighs and rolls his eyes at me. The balance between the weight of the balloon and the lift provided by the gas is so delicate that jettisoning even a very light object causes an immediate vertical displacement.  In this instance, the balloon gains around five hundred feet in altitude. [ACTION] look

Attached to the ropes that hold the balloon aloft is a brass altimeter, the one and only piece of aeronautical equipment that has not been sacrificed. I see a cricket ball here.

It whistles off into the clouds, closely followed by the St.  Bernard, which, like any dog, cannot resist chasing a thrown ball.  Through a gap in the clouds I see the hapless hound land safely in a snow-drift.  At least he will be able to dig himself out. Unburdening the balloon of this large, heavy object causes a sudden and immediate gain in altitude of one thousand feet. [ACTION] inventory

You've really done it this time.  I'm going to tell my Aunt Gertie on you!" "Oh, and I suppose you have your Aunt Gertie secreted away in that incredible overcoat of yours as well..."  I say, mockingly. "Yes," says Hubert, "as a matter of fact I have.  You didn't think I'd leave her at home all on her own, do you?"

[ACTION] cut anchor with hatchet [STATE] Using the hatchet I swiftly hack through the anchor rope sending both the anchor and Hubert's aunt tumbling earthwards.  The parachute on aunt Gertie's back opens instantly, slowing her rate of descent so that she drifts to earth as gently as a dandelion seed. My command of the English language is, alas, inadequate to describe the look on Hubert's face as he watches his beloved aunt disappear into the void.  Lost for words, he struggles to come up with one final snipe: "You...  you...  you...  LOONY!"  before leaping after her.  The great black overcoat billows out around him like his very own parachute. Unburdened of Hubert's enormous weight, the balloon begins to ascend with breathtaking rapidity.  Within seconds we have passed 20,000 feet, then 25,000, then 30,000, at which point I am seized with asphyxia, I lose power to my legs and arms and I begin to lose consciousness...
