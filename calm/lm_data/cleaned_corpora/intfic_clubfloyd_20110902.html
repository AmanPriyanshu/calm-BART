[ACTION] examine paper [STATE] It was about four days west of Arcadia that you came upon the ruins of a pre-war airbase.  The entire complex had been nearly leveled, unfortunately.  No sign of radiation, though, so you went in anyway. There wasn't much to see, and by the looks of it, you guessed that others had already stripped the place clean.  On your way out, though, this scrap of paper caught your eye.  It was scorched in multiple places, but the dry air managed to preserve it remarkably well for the past hundred or so years.

This device counts radioactive particles as they pass through its detector, determining the overall level of radioactivity in an area.

They mainly consist of freeze dried meat, hard tack biscuits, and something claiming to be cheese (a dubious assertion); all individually wrapped to give them a shelf life of several years.  The rations are also quite tasteless, with a texture somewhere between cardboard and asphalt.  Still, they do keep you alive.  You should have all you need for your trip, and then some.

But clearly not everyone has the luxury of making that decision for themselves.  Among the split and crumbling timbers that litter the floor of this basement lie perhaps a dozen dead bodies.  It's hard to tell for certain because the corpses are stacked in a large pile in a corner of the room, the body parts jumbled together like a macabre jigsaw puzzle.  The scent of decay is nearly overwhelming.  The splinters of wood scattered across the ground only enhance the aura of past violence.  Only a single chair seems to have survived the mayhem.

[STATE] First Floor Hallway Once pristine stainless steel has become soiled by the dirty boots of countless pedestrians.

[ACTION] east [STATE] First Floor Hallway East The hallway widens out slightly, expanding several feet to create alcoves to the north and south before constricting again after a span of several strides.  At the far end of each alcove is smooth, featureless door.  Muddy prints indicates that a regular stream of foot traffic passes along this east-west corridor.  More graffiti adorns these walls, and there's a tall wooden bookcase against one wall, partially concealing the northern alcove.  From the east comes a din of numerous voices.

Yesterday I was informed by Dr.  Hill that our network had been accessed by an unauthorized person from off site.  This finally gave me the justification I needed to sever our network from the rest of the outside world.  The general wasn't happy, but he couldn't deny the necessity.  Please have your people search their respective project files for any signs of unauthorized access or tampering. And Dr.  Rock informed me that you're again using your last name as your password.

[STATE] Top of Stairs You are standing on a landing at the top of a flight of steps that runs down to the south.  To the north is a steel sliding door, with a button on the wall beside it, and a brightly illuminated lamp above. The door to the north appears to have been blasted open.  The thick steel is buckled and scorched. Whirling red lights and warning alarms fill the landing. Focusing on the ball of rage adrift within your psyche, you come to the sudden realization that the sensation isn't internal at all.  You look upwards and gape.  The wrathful emotions emanate from the east.  And as you blink in shock, information streams into your mind like a unstoppable tidal wave.  Names and images.  The ceiling before you is overlaid with the scene of two raiders arguing, one of them stalking away and the other left seething.  It loops, going faster and faster before fading away. [ACTION] north [STATE] First Floor Hallway Once pristine stainless steel has become soiled by the dirty boots of countless pedestrians.  Before the war, this hall was almost certainly kept immaculately clean as a necessary process of this research facility.  However, new occupants have been less than fastidious in keeping it in its original condition.  The metal grating beneath your feet is discolored and encrusted with dried mud.  White walls sport numerous scuff marks, gouges and, in several places, lewd and explicit graffiti.  The hallway continues east and west, with an exit north and a door to the south.  That door, you notice, has a number of variations on "out of order" scribbled across its surface.  On the wall beside it is a small panel. The door to the south appears to have been blasted open.  The thick steel is buckled and scorched. Whirling red lights and warning alarms fill the corridor.  Confused and directionless raiders run through the halls, searching vainly for the cause.  You seem to go completely unnoticed. Your Geiger counter chitters quietly. Now your consciousness seems to expand.  More oily recesses of emotion, thought, and knowledge slip into your growing perception.  Just when the terrible flood of awareness seems about to overwhelm you, it dies down to a dull and manageable array of distant auras just on the fringes of your mind.  To your amazement, you find that by concentrating on a particular shard of emotion, you are able to actually scan the thoughts of a single raider.  Feelings, images, and words slither like slimy worms through your brain. The idea that you've discovered a device to read minds from a distance leaves you stunned.  The possibilities dance in your mind, a dizzying galaxy of futures.  For now, though, the only thing you know for sure is that it's time to leave this place. [ACTION] north

[ACTION] north [STATE] Base Entrance At first glance, this might look like a normal clearing in the brush. Tall grass fills in the open space between the taller vegetation, broken only by a path leading northwest.  However, the wide concrete-lined chasm leading down into the ground is a clear indication that this clearing was, at least initially, the result of human labor. The opening is square, with a series of cement steps leading down to the south, ending at a metal-framed doorway.  The concrete surface extends for several feet around the entryway in a wide rectangle.  On the edge of this short plateau, directly in front of the stairs, is a small campfire and, beside it, a bedroll. On the ground you can see a lantern. [ACTION] northwest

To the southeast, you can make out a bright, flickering light from what appears to be a campfire. [ACTION] north

A few amorphous lumps of wood, stone, and other less identifiable materials lie scattered about.  A pile of discarded boards leans against the wall in one corner of the room.  The door to the west leads out into the street. Iona is standing close beside you.  She smiles broadly. Like an unexpected cool breeze cutting through a stifling desert heat, pure and innocent emotions roll over you from the little girl.  You feel curiosity and loneliness mixed with confusion and fear. You hear a faint ticking from your Geiger counter, but nothing to be concerned about. [ACTION] tell iona to follow me

The helmet you keep tucked safely within your survival pack.  Moving as quickly as you can, you rush from the base in search of shelter.  When you come across a series of cliffs you waste no time in taking refuge behind them.  And not a moment too soon.  The sky erupts in dazzling light, followed quickly by thunderous shockwave. A brilliant mushroom cloud rises up over the location of the research facility as its reactor goes critical.  The two of you spend several hours in the shadow, then make your way towards the awaiting city of Arcadia. [Your score has just gone up by 1 point.] The return trip takes slightly longer than the first leg of the journey, though you soon find yourself gazing upon the Cyclopean structures of your home city.  The guards scrutinize yourself and young Iona, but within no time you find yourself once again walking Arcadia's decaying streets. South Gate The high cement wall of Arcadia stretches as far as you can see to the east and west.  Directly south of you, at the end of the street, lies the massive gate that leads out of the city and into the wasteland. This entrance stays guarded at all times; the familiar shapes of armor-clad Enforcers are visible in the lookout posts above and the squat bunkers on either side the street.  Howe Street draws a dark path in the opposite direction, further into the city. Iona is standing close beside you.  She smiles broadly. The tingly sensation seems to be lessening. [ACTION] north
