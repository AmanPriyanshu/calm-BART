[STATE]  You explain about Oscar Talbot and the photo of his daughter that he lost gambling. Tobol shrugs. "He gambled. He lost. What more can I say?" "You could give him the photo back." "I could, but I won't. He gambled fair and square and he lost fair and square. If he wishes to have the photo back, he can go to the guard and see how far that takes him. And why does it concern you anyway? Are you some kind of good samaritan to the drunken and worthless?" "Would you take something else in exchange?" Tobol smiles. "Ah, now we're getting to the heart of the matter, aren't we? Very well. The photo by itself has no value to me. I would take money, but Talbot has none. However, there is a certain pearl I have seen, blue in colour, which rests in the display area of a jewellery shop on Mawbury Lane. It costs, I believe, 2 million credits. I will take that in exchange for the photo." "I hardly think Talbot has 2 million credits just lying around." "Then the photo is mine.

[STATE]  Rowena's Coffee House One of many coffee houses that have sprung up across the city offering cheap, barely drinkable (in your opinion) coffee to people with more money than common sense. This one is of fairly typical design: numerous tables and booths, an harassed looking waitress (the only employee that you can see) and an atmosphere thick with the smell of burnt coffee beans. Only one booth is free at this moment, this being due southwest. You see Oscar Talbot sat close by. To the east lies Tiamont Square. [ACTION] give photo to oscar [STATE]  Talbot's hand shakes as he reaches out to take the photo. "How did you...?" "Don't ask. I'm just glad I could retrieve it for you." Talbot stares at the photo. His eyes fill with tears, but he quickly wipes them away. "Oh, I'm an old fool, gambling with this... But I'm done now. No more gambling for me. I'd die if I lost this again. Tell me, please, how can I repay you?" You tell him there's no need, but he searches about his person for something, anything, to give you by way of payment. Finally he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a scarf. He holds it tightly then hands it to you. "Accept this. Please. It's not much but... years ago, before my daughter died, before my wife left me and I began drinking myself to death, I was a member of a very important club on Mawbury Lane. Bagliatiers. You may have heard of it. This scarf was something we all wore as a badge of our membership. It's not worth much these days - probably almost nothing in fact - but you might be able to sell it for something, and if not just..." He laughs softly. "Just use it to keep warm." He won't take no for an answer so you accept the scarf. Talbot thanks you again, then rises slowly to his feet, still clutching the photo of his daughter, and leaves the coffee house. [ACTION] east

[ACTION] east [STATE]  Tiamont Plaza This is Tiamont Plaza, the heart of the city's Upias District (named after some long-dead scholar, you think). Few people are about, and those you see hurry past quickly, as if unwilling to spend any more time here than they really have to. A large stone statue has been erected here and looks to have become a target for the locals and their graffiti. To the north is Morring Row, south is Belmont Avenue, southeast is a winding path between tall buildings, west lies Rowena's Coffee House and northwest is City Library. [ACTION] southeast

The floor is all marble tiles and the walls fairly shimmer. Steel doors are set into the east wall and look impervious to anything less than a nuclear strike. A small slot to the side looks like the means of access, assuming you have anything that might fit into it. Due west lies Mawbury Lane. You hear footsteps from behind you and turn to see a tall, heavily-built man stood in the doorway. He has the look of a bodyguard or soldier. He notices the scarf you're  wearing and offers a short nod. "Welcome to Bagliatiers, madam. I am Farrah, head of security, at your service." [ACTION] examine door

Gathered around the table are a group of elderly men. "Ah, so good of you come here, Miss Charles," says an elderly gentleman seated in an armchair at the table. "We've been waiting for you." You glance around uneasily. None of the people here can be younger than eighty, but there's nothing frail about them. They have the look of old money and old power. "Who are you are what do you want with me?" you ask. "My name is Carl Mountbatten. I meld." He gestures to the others in the room. "We all meld, but none to quite the extent that you do. We want to recruit you, Miss Charles, for a little job. We also want to talk to you about Tanya." He smiles. "Yes, your sister. She isn't dead and, with your help, we can rescue her." Press a key...
