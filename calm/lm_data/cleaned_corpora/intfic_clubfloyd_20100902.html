[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. You are Steve Goodwin. You're a regular guy, young, successful, dynamic. Recently promoted to the post of junior marketing executive at the Funhouse Novelty Company, you're the one who comes up with all those zany items you can buy for a Dollar in the pages of Cosmic Comics. But something is missing in your life. A nagging question gnaws at your soul, undermines your joy at your new-found success and interferes with the very business of living. But this is not a answer you can find in the pages of any book; for what you yearn to know is the very meaning of life itself!

A six hundred year old hermit living at the top of a mountain in a kingdom most right-thinking people assume to be a myth. A man known as the Dada Lama! And this is why we find you now, after many months of journeying, of fruitless searching, beaten and battered by the uncaring elements, in this mysterious valley hidden deep within the mountains... ...the mystical valley of Shangri-La! Yak Shaving for Kicks and Giggles! A Philosophical Odyssey by J. J. Guest  Shangri-La You weren't sure what to expect from the mystic valley of Shangri-La.

[STATE] Meadow Here, in the foothills of the mountains is a meadow of lush grass, strewn with boulders and dotted with tall wild flowers that frug and shimmy in the breeze. A pastoral idyll in other words, marred only by the fact that someone has erected a barn smack in the middle of it. A windowless wooden box, this barn, of no great architectural merit. Daubed above the entrance are the words "Yak Shed". To the east, a rugged path leads down into the valley whilst other, more ordinally inclined paths lead northeast and southeast. You hear the yeti sounding his barbaric YAWP across the roof of the world... [ACTION] northeast [STATE] Moraine You are standing at the foot of the glacier, a sheer wall of ice that would dwarf the tallest skyscraper. For thousands of years it has followed this valley like the world's most doggedly determined Slush Puppie. Scattered around are immense boulders deposited here by the glacier during its inexorable retreat. Who knows what else might have been swept up in this monstrous river of ice? To the south the holy mountain broods over the valley like a thundercloud. Narrow trails lead southeast and southwest. A hole in the ice, just big enough to crawl through, leads  into the depths of the glacier. Slumped in the middle of the cavern is an extraordinary figure. The abominable snowman, once thought to be a myth, now a hulking four hundred pound fact with muscles like marshmallows! The yeti seems to thawing; his face and hands are a healthy pink but his gigantic feet are still blue with cold. [ACTION] give socks to yeti

[ACTION] give socks to yeti [STATE] Gingerly you tug the socks over the yeti's enormous tootsies, and having lit the blue touchpaper, stand back. After a few moments, his eyelids flicker. A few moments after that, his eyes flick open, he jumps to his feet, does a little dance and gives you big, hairy, smelly bear-hug before crashing out into the open air. [ACTION] examine yeti

[ACTION] give jar to yeti [STATE] "Say, you couldn't lend me a paw with this jar, could you, man?" you say, "It's really been bugging me." The yeti gives you a big, yellow, snaggle-toothed grin. He takes the jar in his huge gnarly hands, pops off the lid like it was nothing, and hands it back to you lidless. Far out. [ACTION] examine jar

A rough, twisting path becomes a narrow traverse that zig-zags its way up the mountainside, its summit obscured by mist. To the west is a pleasant looking meadow, whilst to the east are a scattering of caravans. Far away to the north the Valley is blocked by a sheer wall of ice; an enormous glacier! You hear the yeti sounding his barbaric YAWP across the roof of the world... [ACTION] up

Mystic sigils have been daubed across its rotting sides. Colourful prayer flags flap from ropes tied to the awning poles. Could it be that you have finally found the fabled Sanctum Sanctorum of the Dada Lama? A narrow traverse takes you down to foot of the mountain. You can see a pile of snow here. [ACTION] in

[ACTION] in [STATE] ner Sanctum After your long and arduous journey it's hard not to be disappointed by the famous Sanctum Sanctorum of his Holiness the Dada Lama. Sure, incense burners and mandalas abound, but there's no getting away from the fact that this is nothing more than a shabby old trailer home with seating that folds up to provide additional storage. His holiness the Dada Lama, Exalted Master of the Slanting Moon, sits in the middle of a bubbling hot-tub surrounded by topless beauties. The brunette massages the old man's scalp whilst the blonde lovingly soaps his scanty beard. [ACTION] give jar to dada
