The sect, a group of extremists calling itself the Church of God's Word, seized the facility in December of 2027, after group founder Ellis Vincent, 59, a minor engineer at the facility, claimed that signals emanating from a region in the constellation Cygnus were the revealed word of God. Although scientists once thought those signals might be a message from another intelligent race, light-years distant, most scientists now attribute the signals to a new type of quasar at the fringes of our universe. Despite this, members of the sect continue to believe that Greens Peak, which they call "The Mount," is a holy site, and the radio telescope is the "ear for hearing the word of God." A spokesman for the sect, Holy Keeper Sergei Korn, hailed the ruling as a sign of divine providence and revealed plans for constructing a temple there. Larron Hart, chairman of the American Foundation for Astronomical Research (AFAR), which built and ran the Greens Peak facility, expressed disgust at what he termed "a historically stupid decision," and vowed to appeal. The Church of God's Word, which received a great deal of media attention from the occupation of Greens Peak, has been growing rapidly during the past three years, and it now claims twenty thousand adherents worldwide. Vincent, who is referred to by his followers as the Holy Prophet, has not been seen in public since the takeover. -END OF FILE- [ACTION] north

Commander Rile McLoughlin, the current chief of the BSF, said that the BSF now has "the leeway we need to take the tough stance and courageous steps necessary to keep our nation free from the threat of nuclear blackmail." The BSF was established by Executive Order in 2021, after the completion of the USNA's TROY antimissile shield and the East Bloc's counterpart system fundamentally altered the East-West nuclear arms race from the building of missiles to the smuggling of miniature bombs. In its first nine years, the BSF has thwarted 13 attempts to bring fully armed nuclear devices into the USNA, as well as countless attempts to smuggle various parts and supplies that could be used for the construction of nukes. It is unknown whether any bombs have actually penetrated the American border. USNA and BSF officials have never confirmed the supposition that the BSF's secret charter also empowers it to smuggle nuclear devices into the territory of the East Bloc. The prevention of nuclear smuggling is expected to become even more difficult with the development of the nobelium bomb, a nuclear device which can theoretically fit in a space no larger than a pack of cigarettes. -END OF FILE- [ACTION] north

The following chart shows the growth of the "underground" economy -- income nonreported and therefore not taxed: Year      Nonreported Income     Top Tax Rate 2014             19%                 40% 2018             20%                 40% 2022             23%                 45% 2026             28%                 60% 2030             36%                 80% 2034 (est.)      51%                 88% 2038 (est.)      73%                 96% -END OF FILE- [ACTION] consider [STATE] 7:44 3/16 Mode CURRENT.EVENTS is now closed.

[STATE] 7:48 3/16 PLAN.DATA opened. Current file is RYDER.SPEECHES. [ACTION] r [STATE] 7:49 3/16 Senator Richard Ryder is the foremost spokesman for advocates of the Plan for Renewed National Purpose. Here are excerpts from several of his speeches on the Plan: "I've criticized the shiftless troublemakers in our nation often enough. But I also question the moral decay of our society that turns potentially fine young lads into shiftless troublemakers in the first place! Is it possible we've forgotten the basics of discipline, and misplaced the ability to instill the simple fundamentals of a humane society in our youths?" "Yesterday, I spoke to a man who waited for eleven hours at the local branch of the Federal Firearms Agency, just to get a permit for a gun so he could protect his family and his home. Now, anyone who knows me knows I haven't got a darn thing against legitimate functions of government. But when regulations, paperwork, and flim-flam bureaucracy get so out of hand that it interferes with a man's simple, decent attempt to protect his loved ones and personal property, then I say it's time for a drastic change." "Last year, this country subsidized sick, inefficient, dying industries to the tune of eighty billion dollars. Now, that's a lot of dough. Let's say you're Joe Average-Taxpayer. Last year, you made $90,000 and, if you're honest, you paid about $48,000 in taxes. That means that you spent about $400 so that Penn Steel or Powell Computers or KGN Media Services could stay in business. There are a lot of things Joe could do with that 400 bucks, and almost every one of them would have a healthier effect on our economy than life support for some archaic industry." "A lot of bleeding hearts these days are talking about how we ought to be sending a lot of money and stuff to countries that aren't as lucky as us. These misguided souls seem to think we're some kind of bottomless well of wealth, and they can just keep shipping that well water around the world, telling their thirsty little friends, 'No need for you to knuckle down and solve your problems -- we'll keep bailing you out!' And who are some of these poor little countries we're talking about? Greece! Guatemala! North Korea! Albania! The same countries that are always against the USNA in every issue, every forum, every two-bit propaganda show. I think I speak for a majority of my fellow citizens when I say, 'Let's start looking after our own interests first!'" "Yes, the problems of the nation are many, the troubles of the world are great. There is widespread despair among the people, and a clarion call cries out: 'Why? Why must this be so?' And now, electrified by the power of those cries, clouds of change are gathering on the horizon. Clouds that signify not another storm, but the dawning of a new day! A new day of growth, of prosperity, of hope, of reawakened moral values, of streamlined government, of respect for our country at home and abroad! The Plan for Renewed National Purpose would bring all that and more. The road is long, but with the Lord at our side, we are ready to take that first step!" -END OF FILE- [ACTION] north

[ACTION] r [STATE] 7:51 3/16 The following excerpts are from a position paper issued by Citizens for Sanity in Government, a political action committee working for the reelection of President William Bowden: "Many of today's domestic problems, such as joybooth safety, high energy costs, or residual acidity in our precipitation, exist not because of sophisticated government regulation, but despite it." "Subsidization of industries caught in a changing economic environment is a temporary measure, vital to avoid severe, localized unemployment while retraining workers for healthier industries." "Global instability is exploited by East Bloc adventurism, not caused by it. Instability is the result of underdevelopment and overpopulation, and it will be cured not by militarization of these regions, but by development aid and education. These programs, expensive in this generation, will have tremendous paybacks in the years ahead." "The Plan's supporters are blatantly hypocritical. They call for old-fashioned laissez-faire capitalism, but at the same time they promise protectionist restrictions on trade imports. They pay lip service to the advantages of technological advance, but they quietly prepare to decimate funding for medical research, space exploration, and higher education." "The elements of the misnomered Plan for Renewed National Purpose are either dangerous overreactions to admittedly serious problems, or misguided concepts lacking any merit whatsoever. The Plan is the work of hypocrites and demagogues, clamoring for power by making promises they can never keep. Today's complex problems need and deserve sober, deliberate, difficult solutions, not cosmetic quick-fixes which sound inviting but promise even bigger problems further down the road." -END OF FILE- [ACTION] north

Another major story covers President Ryder's speech for the Distinguished Lecturer Series of the Border Security Force Academy. In his address, the President called the '40s a "decade of new hope," and attributed much of that new hope to the work of the BSF, sending a signal to the entire world that the USNA "won't be pushed around by the biggest dictatorship or the smallest band of terrorist murderers." On one of the inside pages, an in-depth report on crime reveals that, although the overall crime rate has dropped only 4% over the last decade, public perception is that crime has fallen much further. The report attributes this perception to three points: Violent crime has decreased much faster than other types of crime, and is down by 15% from ten years ago. Crime in the schools, which has always gotten the most publicity, has dropped by 40%. Most importantly, offenders are getting harsher sentences, as opposed to the old days of getting off on technicalities, low bail, and easy parole. Other stories in the news section deal with the construction of a new InfoTech orbiting factory, deregulation of the medicinal drug industry, the war in Turkey, and plans for a lunar mining operation.

[ACTION] read newspaper [STATE] 1:19 2/28 > READ NEWSPAPER The headline story in the news section is about the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which are up a stunning 9.7% over last month, yet another indication of the economy's robust performance. Related stories discuss the unemployment rate, which is at the lowest level in almost thirty years, and commercial and housing construction, which are at an all-time high. Another major story covers President Ryder's speech for the Distinguished Lecturer Series of the Border Security Force Academy. In his address, the President called the '40s a "decade of new hope," and attributed much of that new hope to the work of the BSF, sending a signal to the entire world that the USNA "won't be pushed around by the biggest dictatorship or the smallest band of terrorist murderers." On one of the inside pages, an in-depth report on crime reveals that, although the overall crime rate has dropped only 4% over the last decade, public perception is that crime has fallen much further. The report attributes this perception to three points: Violent crime has decreased much faster than other types of crime, and is down by 15% from ten years ago. Crime in the schools, which has always gotten the most publicity, has dropped by 40%. Most importantly, offenders are getting harsher sentences, as opposed to the old days of getting off on technicalities, low bail, and easy parole.

[STATE] 1:19 2/28 > READ NEWSPAPER The headline story in the news section is about the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which are up a stunning 9.7% over last month, yet another indication of the economy's robust performance. Related stories discuss the unemployment rate, which is at the lowest level in almost thirty years, and commercial and housing construction, which are at an all-time high. Another major story covers President Ryder's speech for the Distinguished Lecturer Series of the Border Security Force Academy. In his address, the President called the '40s a "decade of new hope," and attributed much of that new hope to the work of the BSF, sending a signal to the entire world that the USNA "won't be pushed around by the biggest dictatorship or the smallest band of terrorist murderers." On one of the inside pages, an in-depth report on crime reveals that, although the overall crime rate has dropped only 4% over the last decade, public perception is that crime has fallen much further. The report attributes this perception to three points: Violent crime has decreased much faster than other types of crime, and is down by 15% from ten years ago. Crime in the schools, which has always gotten the most publicity, has dropped by 40%. Most importantly, offenders are getting harsher sentences, as opposed to the old days of getting off on technicalities, low bail, and easy parole. Other stories in the news section deal with the construction of a new InfoTech orbiting factory, deregulation of the medicinal drug industry, the war in Turkey, and plans for a lunar mining operation. An editorial calls for lowering draft board requirements in order to ease prison overcrowding. [ACTION] turn off record [STATE] 1:20 2/28 > TURN OFF RECORD Record feature deactivated.

They grew in numbers and in strength, and when the Evil Scientists of the Mount attempted to bar Vincent from the instruments there, he and his Followers rose up and smote the Evil Scientists. And so it came to pass, in 2025, that the Temple was founded on the Mount, and the Instrument of the Word was devoted entirely to listening to God's Word. Vincent interpreted the Words for his Followers, who broadcast the Message around the world, and branches of the Church appeared in many cities. When Vincent finally became very old, and God began to beckon his servant to his side, he taught the wisest of his Followers how to interpret the Word, so that the world would continue to understand the Word after he was gone.

Despite the dropping mortality rate, global population remains stable at just under two billion, with offworlding now running at a staggering seven million people annually. To celebrate next month's special twentieth anniversary Disarmament Day, the World Council has passed a bill authorizing fireworks displays in each of the former capital cities of the twenty-two former nuclear powers. The fireworks displays, by Aerialist designer Jean M'gomo, will feature disarmament themes, and will be the largest display of pyrotechnic art in this century. A story on an inside page catches your eye: "Perry Simm, Noted Author, To Join Crew of Silver Dove," reads the headline. "Perry Simm, author and poet, recipient of the 2089 Mexicana Prize, has been selected from nearly a thousand applicants to be the resident author aboard the Silver Dove, the space colony that is currently being equipped for mankind's first interstellar journey, a trip expected to last a dozen generations."

Suddenly the viewscreen lights up, and Mitchell's face appears. "Hi, Mom, Dad! I wanted to wish you bon voyage, and I enlisted a little help!" He expands the field of vision to include the entire living room of his spacious apartment at the Marine Biology Institute in Nova Scotia. The room is filled with your grandchildren and great-grandchildren, plus various in-laws, more than twenty members of the Simm clan. Everyone is hooting, yelling, waving, and blowing kisses. "We're having a big party in your honor -- I'm only sorry we couldn't be there with you. We're real proud of you both, and excited for you, too. Call me when you get to the habitat! Bye!" The clan signs off by singing Auld Lang Syne, and when the screen goes dark, you notice that Jill's eyes are wet, and a second later you realize that yours are, as well. [ACTION] wait
