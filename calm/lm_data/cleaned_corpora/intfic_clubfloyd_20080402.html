Although you cannot see anything happening directly,  Cheryl's monitor hologram lights up with a multi-colored iridescent sphere which slowly fades away. Cheryl says, "Huh. Just an electromagnetic toy." She sets it down on the slab. A thin, cylindrical, half-meter-long rod, the electropulse probe is a common Yi device for working with certain kinds of Yi technology. The subtle interplay of electric and magnetic fields found in mechanisms can be stimulated with the probe, useful for detection, analysis, or calibration. At one end are two control sensors.

Cheryl Thadafel is a tall, wiry woman in her forties. You spent the last three months looking forward to seeing her again, but now that you do, you wonder why you found her pug nose and staring eyes attractive in your memories. Cheryl is carrying a monitor hologram, a laser pistol, and a key. (Cheryl for the laser pistol) Cheryl says, "You think you're amusing?

Cheryl thinks for a moment and then speaks again. "However, I recall we confiscated a pair of electromagnetic-sensitive goggles from you back when we... found... you here." She speaks into her communicator. Several minutes later, one of the guards stands in the doorway and tosses the goggles on the floor next to you, then leaves. (first taking the electromagnetic goggles) You clumsily struggle to put on the electromagnetic goggles and the room suddenly bursts to life visually. Whorls and eddies of energy play over every surface of the room but the window. Although it is a far cry from being able to directly perceive this much of the electromagnetic spectrum, it is far, far more than you have been forced to live with for some time. The one drawback is that it is difficult to read displays, since the display spectrum is compressed to such a narrow band, and the display circuitry itself is exposed. The twelve contacts are arranged around the edge of the plasma generation zone in perfect symmetry. They all look quite identical. (the white pillar) The fusion generator is an elliptical pillar, with small amounts of energy playing over it. Energy flows in a regulated way across an access panel, which is open, revealing a fusion generator bay.

You need to be holding the electropulse probe before you can put it into something else. You trigger the bottom sensor, and the ambient electromagnetic activity in the probe increases significantly. Time passes. Timing your action carefully, you touch your fingertip gently against the calibration stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it. A sharp, multi-colored burst of electromagnetic radiation pulses out of the tip of the probe. The contact points in the fusion generator bay resonate in response. You are confident it will power up now. This is the only stud you were able to activate when you were here before, and you are positive that it will produce the information Cheryl's looking for--which would make her bring today's session to a halt. It might be enough information for her to figure out what this place is; if so, you'd never get a chance to try again. So you better not activate it unless you've got a way to stop her. There are a number of studs whose function you are fairly certain of and which might prove relevant: a calibration stud, a tool stud, a generator access stud, an information stud, a powerup stud, a project status stud, a sequence stud, and a forcefield stud. You touch your fingertip gently against the powerup stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it. Nothing happens. It would be typical of the Yi to have a safety interlock which requires the access panel be shut. [ACTION] sing [STATE] Your singing is abominable. [ACTION] shut panel

You touch your fingertip gently against the powerup stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it. The fusion generator pillar radiates a sequence of colors: dark red, deep purple, light blue, and then builds and peaks with a very bright yellow. Cheryl's monitor hologram reveals significant electromagnetic activity beginning to occur within the fusion generator. It looks like powering up was a good place to start; that was fairly obvious. But you have no intuition about what to do next with a mechanism on this scale; the grid of stud offers thousands of studs, any of which could plausibly be involved. Cheryl says, "You're making quite a bit of progress, Tolan." You say, "No. This is little more than turning the lights on." You touch your fingertip gently against the sequence stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it. The viewscreen lights up, pulsing and probing energies dancing all over its surface. Cheryl notices the changed display on the viewscreen. "What is that? Move away from the controls, Tolan. I want to decipher that text." She draws her laser pistol and points it at you. You look down at the viewscreen as you raise your hands for Cheryl and determine that this is exactly what you needed to know. Unfortunately, you'll never get the chance to make use of the information. *** You have lost *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move or QUIT?
