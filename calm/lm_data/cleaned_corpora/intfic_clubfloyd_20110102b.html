We were born a month apart, but he was born on Earth and I was born on board the MAGELLAN millions of kilometers away. He has never been in space before.

[ACTION] weightlessness [STATE] It does seem very limiting that on Earth you can't just go wherever you want if there's something blocking your path. You are bound to a single direction. You can only use a single side of a room effectively, whereas here you can--and must--use every available surface to your advantage. There was a time when I considered gravity my nemesis that kept me from going home. Then I came to realize how insane it is to hate a force of nature and directed my energy to more tangible things.

A breath of air caresses my being and the Sun's warmth feels so soft. Actual atmosphere is so much gentler than Magellan's artificial environment. "Is everything allright, young man?" I hear someone ask. "Yes," I manage to whisper. It's hard to speak when you have to fight the pull of gravity with all the strength you have. A woman behind me catches me as I fall.
