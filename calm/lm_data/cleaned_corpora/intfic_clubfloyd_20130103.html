"You have no idea of the horrors that await you, warrioress from the stars. These tunnels have long been recaptured by things worse than light grues. You will die in these depths, like your friend, alone and forgotten. What do you say to that?" The Venusian kicks her in the face, and the grue falls. "I say you passed your last Bechdel test, you bit-" You pull on her arm. "No time to offend more sensitive Clubfloyd player" you say. " We need to, I guess we have to..." You sit down. "I guess I should..." The Venusian puts a hand on your shoulder. "He'd want you to go on." Garden Area. Pauls Parents are rather fond of this small pool south of their house.
