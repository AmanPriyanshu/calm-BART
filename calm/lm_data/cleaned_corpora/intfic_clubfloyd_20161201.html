Now, if you can only slip unnoticed to the side wall that is never guarded, and just climb up to the first floor terrace, then it should be easy to...

[ACTION] talk to circe [STATE]  You put your left fist to your left temple, performing the adoration gesture. Circe pays no attention to you. You ahem-ahem a little, still to no reaction from the High Priestess, so you just chatter away. "My potnia, I come on behalf of my beloved sister..." "Now, that is a droll one", she mutters, still not looking at you. She rereads a line from a tablet, then moves another figurine over the map. "I bring my beloved sister Phaedra's respect and best wishes for the High Priestess, on the occasion of my noble sister's ordainment..." "I am sure you must be very proud of her, are you not?", she says dryly. "Very" you reply with equal enthusiasm, "As proud as if it was my own and belated induction into the Goddess' mysteries", you drone on monotonously. "Do I hear a complaint?" "Actually..." "Shut up, it's a rhetorical question. Because I hear many complaints every day, and quite a few have something to do with one of my nieces being somewhat unruly." Being essentially a sensible young woman despite what certain uncharitable individuals might think, you let that one pass and force a smile. "Anything else?", she asks. You are biting your tongue, hard. [ACTION] again

"Marry as you please. The world is full of bloody royals, do you know how many new siblings you've gotten since you came? Every petty warlord has two or three score bastards, and do you know what a nightmare genealogy has become? I should know, my father is the bloody Sun. Anyway.

"Don't you explain the Goddess to me, man, I'm a bloody potnia! So you pulled out your little trick, not that I mind because they were Achaean scum anyway, and then tried to sell the stuff in town. You made just one mistake - bedding me! I do not mean that as a literal mistake, mind you. But when you mess with Ariadne, secret agent of the High Priestess..." "Please, holy Ariadne...!" "Oh, shut up. Circe will be certainly interested in these shipwrecked Achaeans, she does give not a fig for thieving goatherders. But you should have told me in the first place." You take one last good look around. Being pretty sure you have learned all there was to discover here, you say a brief prayer to the Goddess - to guide the dead northerners to her underground realm, even if they scarcely deserve it. The goatherd stands respectfully at attention, although there is no way he can understand your oration, delivered in your native Cretan. Out of the corner of your eye, you see something stir among the rocks! And the goatherder has seen it as well, because he jumps scared, thinking it is one of the corpses rising. Being an initiate in the first mysteries, you go investigate, intoning incantations against the wrath of the dead. But the boy is not quite dead. He is a young one, of perhaps eleven or twelve years old, barely standing on his two feet, reeking of seawater and malnutrition. He collapses as soon as you reach him.

[STATE]  "You see, my potnia, me and my friend found this last new moon, and though we tried to save the sailors..." "Goatshit", you interrupt, turning towards him with a dramatic flourish, "You tricked them into running aground, surely with some lamps. Do you expect a potnia to believe this Achaean warship just happened to shipwreck here, on the only beach in the whole coast, on a moonless night, and in the only spot where you and your mate would be able to loot their ship?" "Well..." "Don't answer, you fool. It's what we priestesses call a rhetorical question." "Actually, maybe it is a gift from the Goddess herself..." "Don't you explain the Goddess to me, man, I'm a bloody potnia! So you pulled out your little trick, not that I mind because they were Achaean scum anyway, and then tried to sell the stuff in town.

What is your name and how come you where aboard an Achaean warship?" "My-my name is Icarus", he says, making a feeble attempt at an adoration gesture, "and my father was...", and there he clams up, opening his eyes wide and looking at you with a suspicious expression. You tsk-tsk. "I am not one of them. My name is Ariadne, and I am the daughter of the Wanassa of Knossos, whom you surely have heard of. So what about your father?" "Hmph. He's a fisherman."

I am not a friend at all of the awful men that got you. Did they get your father as well? Let me guess, he is an important man in Crete, am I right? A lagawetes, perhaps? A commander?" "A fisherman, like I said, from Phaistos." "Goatshit. You have the Knossos accent, Icarus, and your skin is too white and soft for the son of a fisherman, not to mention your clothes.

[ACTION] show daidala to boy [STATE]  "Is this perchance yours?" you ask, producing the bull statuette with a theatrical gesture. He hesitates, wanting to trust the lovely lady with the hometown accent, but still scared. You smile encouragingly. "It belongs to your mysterious father. And his only reason for owning a sacred object would be being a priestess, and from my authoritative experience as a priestess, men are rarely priestesses, or vice versa. So your father must be a maker of daidala, and there are not many of those, not even in my father's palace, so. See how the Goddess speaks through me? Tell me the rest, Icarus, for Her patience is much scarcer than her wisdom." "My father is indeed a daedalus," he sighs, giving up, "and we were on the run when the Achaeans got us. They boarded our ship just out of Phaistos, and Father fell overboard. I was taken captive." "You were on the run from what?", you ask, but you already know the answer. "Your noble father, potnia. For a crime he did not commit!" You smile reassuringly and pat his head. Now this is something Circe shall be interested in - courtly intrigue of which Mother has told her nothing, Achaean warships roaming very close to Cretan ports, a targeted kidnapping, and a smart kid with fresh news about it all.

Men and oxen come on go along the road like ants and mill around the vast plaza, transporting all manners of goods from the palace stores to the port below, overseen by administrative-rank priestesses and keen-eyed archers. The great complex is three stories high, fronted with a majestic row of crimson red and marine blue tapered columns. A few priestesses blink, then nod respectfully as they pass, eyeing your attire.

The western wing contains the workshops, stores and administrative dependencies. The north wing is mainly taken up with living quarters for priestess in the upper floors, and servants and slaves in the lower ones. But the definitive majestic piece of the megaron is the monumental gipsum stairway leading up, to the High Priestess' dependencies. The megaron is in full swing, with dozens of priestesses of diverse rank coming and going about palace business. Icarus arrives from the outside. [ACTION] up
