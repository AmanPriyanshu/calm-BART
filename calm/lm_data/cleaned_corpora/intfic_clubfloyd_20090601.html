You don't know which session to check out first. Unlike your hometown, you're one promoter among many here -- exciting and intimidating. Exciting because between now and Friday you might be able to put together a game development team with the varied people here, but intimidating because you don't know a soul. Luckily people all have their names printed on their badges, that's one thing you don't have to worry about. Game Developers Conference 2009 A social interaction simulator by Jim Munroe.

Sure, there's a lot of swag, but it's not about what you can TAKE, he said. It's about the exchange of ideas. ASK people ABOUT something they care about. If you don't know, ASK them ABOUT INTERESTS. And if you have an interest, TALK ABOUT it TO them -- maybe your enthusiasm about it will catch. And he said not to worry about getting it right the first time, that it can take a couple of years to get into the groove. You're pretty sure there was some other stuff he said, too.
