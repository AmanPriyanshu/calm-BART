[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Foreshadowing. You've travelled a long way to reach this place. A cursed city, some call it, others a city of the unliving. A city where the Fallen One holds sway and certainly not a place visited lightly by those without great need to come here. But you have a need, and a great one at that. Somewhere in Foreshadowing lives (or, more accurately, hides) a man known as Taktaal, once a torturer from Galamenkaris, City of the Imperium, now a fugitive with a price on his head and the Steel Eyes of the Imperium on his trail.

A long line of people, most dressed in little more than rags and bearing signs of the Wasting Sickness, are here to seek access to the city; an access given grudgingly it seems, for the hulking guards at the gate appear to turn away far more people than they admit. At this rate, it will take many hours to gain admittance - if, indeed, you are allowed inside at all, which is hardly a guarantee. But this is the only way into the city. The other gates are kept permanently locked and warded with the kind of spells you don't have a hope of bypassing - only here, at the southern most gate, might you find a way inside Foreshadowing.
