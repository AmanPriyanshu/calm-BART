The explosion that tears through you demolishes much of Summit Avenue. *** Your hunger is sated *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command? [ACTION] south [STATE]  You choose to flee with the Heart.  Stu won't get it, and neither will anyone else!  You scramble over the fallen figures littering the sanctuary, and head south through the doorway.  Somehow you find your way through a maze of corridors until you're outside.  A cement truck lumbers down the street.  Perfect!   You take hold of the Heart, cock your arm and prepare to destroy the thing.  Then Stu arrives, with a squad of police chasing close behind.  "I'll take that," he growls, as he wrests the Heart away from you.  With the first bite, he begins to grow even more massive.  His jaw unhinges like a great serpent's, and he swallows the rest of the Heart in one gulp.  Tentacles emerge from his torso, and he soon towers over the nearby buildings.  It's pretty cool.  Then he grabs you.  Oh, right. *** You are among the first to be eaten *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command? [ACTION] give pillow to stu

You stare, dumbstruck, as the last surviving members of the congregation quiver their last.  Stu strides over their bodies triumphantly.  Mission accomplished, I guess?  You didn't expect him to take it all the way, but Stu has been waiting for this moment for quite a while.  He's fired up and ready to roll.  Glancing at you dismissively, he snatches the Heart and tears into it with his suddenly-sharp teeth.  With the first bite, he begins to grow more massive.  His jaw unhinges like a great serpent's, and he swallows the rest of the Heart in one gulp.  Tentacles emerge from his torso, and he bursts through the ceiling with a primeval roar.  It is glorious. Even though you lost the Heart to begin with, you did at least make an effort to retrieve it, and Stu is feeling magnanimous.  You serve at his right tentacle for a brief while until the mood passes, and you are consumed. *** You are among the last to be eaten *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?

[ACTION] blow shofar [STATE]  (first taking the shofar) You leap over to the podium and grab the horn.  Seized by a sudden flash of insight and pity, you inhale until you're full to bursting, and put the horn to your lips.  You sound a massive, deep blast that reverberates against the walls of the sanctuary.  You keep the blast going, a single piercing note, forcing the air from your lungs until they begin to ache.  You look up, and see the congregation recovering. The horn's blast is drowning out the crystal!  Leah slowly uncurls herself, opens her eyes, and sees you sounding the horn.  She seems oddly calm now, and starts to crawl away. Still you blow, your face turning red, then purple, the same note sounding, shaking the very walls of the temple.  You close your eyes as you expel the last bit of air.  Finally, there's a cracking sound, and a pulse of white light.  The crystal shatters. The rabbi stands, a trickle of blood running along his jawline and down his chin.  "Tekiah gedolah!" he shouts, as the other congregants snap out of their fugues.  Suddenly, there's another crack, and your dumbstruck uncle crumples to the ground.  Standing over him is Leah, clutching a Torah in both hands.  Her face is caked with blood, her dress dirty and wrinkled, her mascara running in thick black streaks down her face.  She looks up at you and smiles.  She's the most beautiful woman you've ever seen.  Three Saint Paul policemen burst in with tasers and handcuffs, but frankly, their job has been done for them. "I knew you couldn't be all bad," Leah says, between strained breaths. "You were so gentle with my roommate's beagle when we brought her in with a scratched eye last winter.  It was really sweet."  At this, she throws up.  Still, it's a nice moment. press any key Como Park One year later.  You stand under the chuppah on a warm summer day in Como Park.  Sailboats and canoes dot the lake in front of you.  The air is filled with bird songs and the scent of flowers.  Leah stands to your right, beaming and crying.  Behind you are several dozen guests.  On her side: her parents, family, and friends.  On yours: Sandy, Jeff, and some of the other guys from the cult.  Yeah, the cult is still operating, but it's pretty mellow now.  Fewer human sacrifices, more pancake breakfasts.  Mostly now it's just a way to feel like you're part of something. The rabbi places his hands upon your heads and intones a final prayer.
