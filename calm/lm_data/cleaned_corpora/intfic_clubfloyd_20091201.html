You are, no doubt, using some implementation of the Glulx interpreter written for your specific hardware -- it could be your entertainment corner, hologoggles, dishwasher, cortical implant -- whatever.  Even if you are using some old silicon-semiconductor clunker from the International days, it should still work. We've made every effort to test it on a number of platforms, but these tests are far from comprehensive. So far as we know, there are no interpreter-specific issues.  However, if the game doesn't run right for you, you could try another interpreter and see if that fixes the situation. Whether you think the problem is the interpreter or the game itself, we'd appreciate it if you'd let us know.

You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua that had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called "shaved rat" gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears, and flies across the park into the arms of a stooped grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in a strong Earth accent "That mongrel should be on a leash!" Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. "Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don't know what you've got!". You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, "Kids. Meh." David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching? Janet: No, the ACU's dreams are heavily influenced by power-up state of the processor and internal noise. Every time the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can be pretty bizarre.

David: Do you like Thai? *    *    * Rover's Day Out An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N) Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua that had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called "shaved rat" gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears, and flies across the park into the arms of a stooped grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in a strong Earth accent "That mongrel should be on a leash!" Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. "Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don't know what you've got!". You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, "Kids. Meh." David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching? Janet: No, the ACU's dreams are heavily influenced by power-up state of the processor and internal noise. Every time the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can be pretty bizarre. David: Good, I'd hate to think that we wasted two weeks of programming. Janet: I wouldn't say wasted. David: Huh? I didn't mean us. Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn't crash again on the heat lamp.  IRRADIATOR SWITCH -> PRESSOR FIELD : NIL [ACTION] examine me [STATE] Lying down. Wearing pajamas.

David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially no atmosphere to break against and it has about nine times Earth gravity. Even with optimal approach we'll have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to make a soft landing. Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take years before our next Casimir ship will be built, and who knows if Valkyrie will survive that long on that chthonian rock. David: Nice word.
