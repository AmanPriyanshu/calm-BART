Sickened and dizzy, you stagger back. A wispy translucent shape rises from the corpse of Belboz. It speaks in a voice so deep that your whole body seems to hear it. "Foolish Charlatan! I am forced to flee that weak, old body -- I shall take your own, instead! Already I have sucked all knowledge, all secrets from that ancient Enchanter. Now begins an epoch of evil transcending even your worst nightmares; a reign of terror that will last a thousand thousand years!" The shape blows toward you on a cold wind. Jeearr surrounds you like a cloud and begins to contract. Suddenly, it strikes your invisible protection and recoils as if burned. "No!" it cries. "Such a guileless Enchanter developing a mind shield?" The cloud is thinner, the voice fainter. "It cannot be! I cannot survive ... without a host." The demon roils in agony, then thins and dissipates. There is a final scream of pain, then silence. Jeearr is vanquished; the kingdom is saved. But you - you are stranded in a land unknown, and your closest friend, the greatest Enchanter of his age, lies dead by your own hand. Kneeling by his blood-soaked corpse, you beg for another chance... Your score is 310 of a possible 400, in 690 moves. This puts you in the class of Member of the Circle of Enchanters.
