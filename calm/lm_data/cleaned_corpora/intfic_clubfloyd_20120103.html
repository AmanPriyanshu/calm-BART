It flutters a few feet, bows to king and queen, gives you a sharp look, and finally rests in a corner. "So..." she says slowly, "You came..." and the heavy burden lifts from her chest like a huge and terribly beast, now harmless, and you can almost see it fleeing through the open doors. Slowly, she stands up and takes a few steps down the stairs and puts a hand on his shoulder. He looks up at her. "How could I waste so much time, dear? How could I be so terribly selfish and stupid?" She strokes his hair for a long time, while he hangs his head, sobbing quietly. Then she looks up. "We will have to rebuild this kingdom. We will have to get new servants and officials. Oh, all the work..." And suddenly, she looks old again. Then the king gets up, puts one arm around her, and looks straight at you.

[STATE] Throne Hall The queen lies sleeping on her throne. She snores a little. The King follows you. As the king enters, the queen wakes, as if startled from a nightmare. He slowly walks up to her throne and gets on one knee. The jar suddenly shatters in your hands, and the mighty phoenix is free! It flutters a few feet, bows to king and queen, gives you a sharp look, and finally rests in a corner. "So..." she says slowly, "You came..." and the heavy burden lifts from her chest like a huge and terribly beast, now harmless, and you can almost see it fleeing through the open doors. Slowly, she stands up and takes a few steps down the stairs and puts a hand on his shoulder. He looks up at her. "How could I waste so much time, dear? How could I be so terribly selfish and stupid?" She strokes his hair for a long time, while he hangs his head, sobbing quietly. Then she looks up. "We will have to rebuild this kingdom. We will have to get new servants and officials.
