Looking to the west, low hills stretch to the horizon, and small pieces of the Long Road can be seen winding their way to distant lands.

When it had reached the scroll, the enchanters trapped it there with a spell that encased it in the living rock. The Terror was so horrible that none would dare speak of it.

The cell door opens and you are marched solemnly to the temple and, from there, up the steps to the altar. The large, black figure approaches menacingly. He reaches into his cloak and pulls out a great, glowing dagger. He pulls you onto the altar, and with a murmur of approval from the throng, he plunges the blade into your heart! ****  You have died  **** You awaken among the members of the Circle. Belboz the Necromancer looks tired, and scattered about are the remains of the components of a spell of great healing power. The other members of the Circle are pleased to see you revived, but worried by the setback. "I think Krill is too powerful," says one. "This inexperienced wizard will never defeat one so puissant as he." Quiet discussion ensues, with well-concealed acrimony beneath the surface. Debate ensues, with Belboz returning frequently to the contents of the ancient manuscript. His wishes prevail, and it is agreed to send you back....

In addition, a certain five-headed monster sporting razor-sharp spears for tongues seems to be imbedded within its heavy oak frame. One is almost embarrassed to mention the gargoyles spewing flame and sulphurous ash which ornament either side of the door, or the ninety-seven slimy groping tentacles which taunt you ever closer to certain death.

In addition, a certain five-headed monster sporting razor-sharp spears for tongues seems to be imbedded within its heavy oak frame. One is almost embarrassed to mention the gargoyles spewing flame and sulphurous ash which ornament either side of the door, or the ninety-seven slimy groping tentacles which taunt you ever closer to certain death.

He is carrying a dusty book, a beautiful, ornamented egg, a worn silver spoon, a sword, and a brass lantern. He seems pleased to see you and frequently smiles in your direction. An enormous turtle is here, its enamelled shell shining with all the colors of the rainbow. "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor. The adventurer leaves the room, heading downstairs.

[STATE] Engine Room The room is filled with noise: crashing and smashing, gurgling of water, grinding of gears, and horrible screeching of metal. Huge devices of obscure purpose provide these effects. The most notable is a huge hammer that smashes continually against the stone floor: it makes any crossing of the room a dangerous enterprise.

[STATE] The first page of the book was the table of contents. Only two chapter names can be read: The Legend of the Unseen Terror and The Legend of the Great Implementers. "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor. [ACTION] read unseen terror [STATE] This legend, written in an ancient tongue, goes something like this: At one time a shapeless and formless manifestation of evil was disturbed from millenia of sleep. It was so powerful that it required the combined wisdom of the leading enchanters of that age to conquer it. The legend tells how the enchanters lured the Terror "to a recess deep within the earth" by placing there a powerful spell scroll. When it had reached the scroll, the enchanters trapped it there with a spell that encased it in the living rock. The Terror was so horrible that none would dare speak of it. A comment at the end of the narration indicates that the story is considered to be quite fanciful; no other chronicles of the age mention the Terror in any form. [ACTION] translucent
