[STATE] Dining Room The dining room is simply what you call the collection of tables here where the girls come to eat. However, it is fairly large, so it is often used as a meeting room as well. Tables and chairs have been pushed to the edges of the room for the demonstration. A cupboard stands in the corner. South leads to the hallway. You can see spilled rice, a table (on which are Pari and some ropes), a cupboard (empty), and the rice cooker (in which is cooked rice) here. [ACTION] cut rope with can opener [STATE]  You rub the blade of the can opener against the rope restraining Pari's left arm. Although it takes a minute, you are eventually able to cut through enough of the fibers to be able to bite it off. From there, you continue cutting the ropes binding the other three limbs, getting faster as you go, partly due to experience and partly due to fear. Eventually, you free Pari, who stumbles onto the ground, limping slightly. She says, "Thank you so much. But we have to go now." [ACTION] south
