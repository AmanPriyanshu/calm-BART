Thanks to all the authors, players, poets, reviewers, and others who have led me to think about writing, computing, and interactive fiction in new ways. Book and Volume was written in Inform, a language for IF development created by Graham Nelson. It runs on the Z-Machine, a software computer developed by Joel Berez and Marc Blank. I particularly want to thank the following people, who played pre-release versions of Book and Volume and who offered their thoughts and transcripts: Ian Bogost Jeremy Douglass Josh Kellar Ryan McDonald Scott Rettberg Dan Shiovitz Emily Short Dirk Stratton Jill Walker Hanna Wallach Noah Wardrip-Fruin Thanks to Andrew Suffield, Brian Rapp, Jose Manuel Garcia, Brian Kerr, Jeremy Rogers, and Andrew Plotkin for post-release bug reports. Also, I'm very grateful that I was given the opportunity to read from pre-release versions of Book and Volume at The Richard Stockton College, at The Kelly Writers House at the University of Pennsylvania, and at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at the University of Maryland. Finally, thanks go to these Philadelphia coffeehouses, in which much of Book and Volume was written: Intermezzo, Crimson Moon, Capriccio, and The Last Drop. --Nick Montfort, 2005 === an [auto mata] release >I  Introduction to interactive fiction >A  Author's note and acknowledgments >L  License information >R  Restore a previous session >B  Begin a new session [ACTION] backwards

[ACTION] intro [STATE] ( Interactive fiction provides a world, complete with a setting that is a simulated space, objects and characters that exist within that space, and even unusual physical laws. This world and the things that happen in it are described to you, the player, in text. You control a character, the "player character," by typing short commands that express what you want the character to do next. Many simple commands that you could give to an actor, standing on stage with the appropriate props around, should be understood. The ">" prompt is what indicates that it's your turn to type something, for instance: >OPEN THE CD CASE >PURCHASE A WIDGET >ASK THE GOON FOR THE TIME The first of these is only a sensible command when there is a CD case in the player character's possession or in the area; the second can only be expected to work if the player character has money and is somewhere where widgets are sold; and the last command will only be meaningful if there is a goon nearby or otherwise available for communication. Headings, shown in bold, indicate the current location of the player character. The current location is also named in the upper right; the obvious ways to leave are indicated in the upper left. The command EXITS will result in the obvious ways to leave being named explicitly. Upon entering a location, the area will be described. To take a closer look at something in the location or in the player character's possession, you can EXAMINE or LOOK AT it. In Book and Volume, the first description may provide more commentary or reminisces than later descriptions. You can command the player character to manipulate things in the world, too: to pick up certain things, turn some devices on and off, and eat food, for instance. The player character can also be commanded to talk to some other characters. SCORE and FULL SCORE provide some information about how you are progressing at some tasks. First-time players are sometimes frustrated that certain commands will not work, but there is some sort of system to interactive fiction. The sort of commands that usually don't work include: [No...] >DONATE MY ORGANS TO SCIENCE Unless the player character has just been presented with a blank organ donor card, there would be no obvious way to do this. Even in that case, something more specific and concrete, such as CHECK THE TOP BOX, might be more effective. Commands should generally have something to do with concrete things in the immediate area, although conversations with other characters might be about abstract topics. [No...] >GO TO TANGIERS The player character is usually only able to move around locally, following such commands as GO NORTH, LEAVE, and GO TO THE RESTAURANT (when there is a single restaurant in the immediate area). An indicator in the upper left shows what directions the player character can move in. You can also type EXITS to see these directions listed. More generally, complex actions that involve numerous steps (purchasing a plane ticket, booking a hotel room, packing for a trip, arranging ground transportation to the airport, waiting in line at security, and so on) cannot usually be accomplished with a single command. Some actions of moderate complexity might be possible with single commands, however, if they are routine ones for the player character. [No...] >WALK TO THE COFFEE TABLE If there's a coffee table in the room, you can just directly command the player character to do several things: look at it, take things off it, put things on it, and so forth. There's usually no need to move the player character around in front of specific pieces of furniture; just specifying what is to be done is enough. [No...] >SLYLY SPRYLY RUN One problem is that the command does not specify where to run to or what direction to run in. Also, the adverbs will not be understood. Generally, adverbs are unnecessary. You are asked to choose what basic things the player character does, not the very fine details of how those actions are accomplished. You may want to take some notes as you play interactive fiction. Traditionally, players have drawn a map as they progress through a particular interactive fiction world; this may or may not be necessary for particular people playing particular pieces of interactive fiction. Finally, playing interactive fiction with others, in person or online, is probably the best introduction. Even if your fellow players are not interactive fiction experts, different people will have different good ideas about how to make progress, and working together can be fun. ) [ACTION] south

With a grinding pull, a battalion in green aprons hurls itself over you and into the structure on the southwest corner. Perhaps you glimpse a pair of stunned figures in black T-shirts inside, shivering behind a counter. Your vision seems to be obscured for a moment by a milky steam. You stand, finally, unsure about what you seem to have witnessed, unsure about whether or not to hope it was real. Main & Fourth One corner of the nWare Media Campus is to the northeast, where a path affords entrance. There are Starbuckses on the other three corners. A sizable crowd of people wearing tye-dyed bedsheets babbles loudly, running past and away from you. You head south on Main... Main & Fifth The building to the northeast houses "Scales," a restaurant. The government-looking neo-something architecture of City Hall offers an entryway to the southeast. On the southwest corner is "Wheel-Man," a personal transportation dealer. The final business here, to the northwest, is Mailboxes Ultra.
