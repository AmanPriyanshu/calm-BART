I can't believe you dated someone so crass. 11.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "Impressive, huh?  When I was in high school my guidance counsellor recommended that I become a contortionist." 12.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "It's not so much that I'm double jointed as just very determined." 13.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "Sure, she's cute.  If you can get past the mole." Hey!  Watch it, Julia. 14.  You are distracted by Julia saying "She makes things that look like summer camp crafts and tries to convince people they're art." I wonder if I'd get away with it if I killed her right before my flight leaves tomorrow morning. 15.  You are distracted by Julia loudly saying "I bet when they first hooked up, she was like, 'Would you like to see my didgeridoo?'"  (That has to be the most gallingly inept fake Australian accent I have ever heard.  She sounds like a Norwegian parakeet.) 16.  You are distracted by Julia laughing and mock-shrieking "Or maybe, 'Touch my kiwi!  Touch my kiwi!'"  Ugh.  How can someone almost have her Ph.D. and not know that kiwis are New Zealand, not Australia? 17.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "You've been working out.  I've noticed." Oh no. 18.  You are distracted by Julia squealing, "Wait, it's your birthday, too?  Why didn't you tell me earlier?" 19.  You are distracted by a startled grunt from Historic Pfister.  I do not believe this is happening. 20.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister making noises perhaps best characterised as mewling. 21.  You are distracted by Julia saying, "Wait, if today is the 24th, and you are 24, that makes this your golden birthday."  Well, then. 22.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister's shrieking attempts to summon a deity. 23.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister saying excitedly, "Okay, now you're a princess, and I'm a ninja!" 24.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister making a noise that doesn't sound very much like a ninja, unless there is an order of yodelling ninja I don't know about. 25.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister making contented little yelping sounds. You have to pee.

Freese also leeched off I7 extensions written by Emily Short, David Fisher, and Jon Ingold. Freese pestered readers of rec.arts.int-fiction for aid, and among those who helped were J.D. Clemens, Eric Eve, Jesse McGrew, Peter Pears, Andrew Plotkin, Emily Short, and (especially) Mike Tarbert. Freese badgered others into beta testing, including Gemma Bristow, Corey Colyer, James Cunningham, Benji Dahood, Molly Geene, Dan Hirschman, Javri, Tiffany Julian, Sarah Morayati, Carl Muckenhoupt, Lucy Pigpuppet, Reiko, Thomas Say, Stephan Schonberg, and Ramona White. Eric Dean Freese made cover art. [ACTION] push space
