The file cabinets are a pale yellow, like raw milk, and each stands about 38 inches high. There is a maladjusted ceiling tile, and scruffy stains on the padded carpeting. In the north wall is a window, about two and a half feet square, with a crank latch. A copier machine sits near the wall, bearing no make or marking that you recognize, even though no company produces generic photocopiers that you know of. Even more curiously, the wall socket behind it is empty, meaning that the copier is not plugged in, and yet it definitely seems to be turned on.

[STATE]  You follow Zarf through the west wall. You hear Melvin yelling, "Bad bird! Bad!" Control Room (as Peter and Valerie) This is the control room for all the machinery nearby. The controls are all magical, of course. The walls are covered by blinking lights and shifting displays, interspersed with arcane dials and glowing buttons. It's all very mysterious looking. The exit, to the northwest, leads into a room with machinery which would surely crush you if you were to attempt to enter it. A scroll of old, brittle parchment is here. "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor outside. Zarf says, "Take the scroll." [ACTION] take scroll [STATE]  (the brittle scroll) Peter takes the brittle scroll. Zarf says, "I need to take my own detour. You two, take the northwest exit, wait for Melvin, and incapacitate him. Lay a trap if need be. I'll rejoin you after." "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor outside. "Are you sure we can get through that?" Peter asks. Zarf touches a shadow and vanishes. "Oh. Great." "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor outside. Melvin bursts in from the east wall, covered with talon scratches and roc feathers. "Note to self: Don't mess with the roc egg," he says. [ACTION] northwest

[ACTION] northwest [STATE]  You make it across the room, but just barely; just as you duck through the door, a huge hammer crashes down behind, missing by an inch. Something you stepped on along the way clicked as well, and with a horrible screeching noise, the machinery speeds up, crashing faster and faster until it's twice as fast as before. From behind, you hear Melvin cry, "Hey! No fair!" That machinery ought to slow him down for at least a minute or two. Dead End (as Peter and Valerie) It is the classic dead end. More than that, it is the archetypal dead end. Nowhere forward, nowhere back. The ceiling shocks with its height, the walls oppress with their closeness. There are no exits. Melvin will be here at any moment. "Do we know what to do?" Valerie asks Peter. "I hope so, or we're dead." Peter says. [ACTION] examine scroll

[ACTION] climb hole [STATE]  I don't think much is to be achieved by that. There is a terrific crash and then a fast series of metallic whupping noises. Melvin comes limping in through the southeast wall, looking the worse for wear. Several spears are skewered in his sides, and one leg drags limply behind him. "My ray gun got smashed by the hammer," he mopes.He looks down in the pit and laughs. "What are you doing down there, digging a latrine? Don't worry about that. Time to die."

However, the magic is too powerful to be constrained. The more he reads, the clearer his pronunciation becomes, as the magic works through him. As he finishes the incantation, there is a noise like the rushing of open wind through a great tunnel. The secret door ripples and shimmers, trapped in a state between reality and mirage.
