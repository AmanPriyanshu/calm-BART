Goaded into helping, Medic touches the Mercy in an intricate breath-sharing dance that restores her body. Rosa's body collapses out of your control, inoperative, just as the Mercy's body gasps into life. Medic glances over, and eye-snares you. Medic tumbles black: forward and back, then expands and contracts. Medic whispers to herself of escape as she flees to the quarterdeck. "Thank you, Sarah," the Mercy buzzes to the long-absconded Medic. There is a distinct change in her timbre: bemusement and detachment towards her old world. She notices your presence, and pretends to address Assister, again in the same tone, "I'm feeling much better, Wenig, and I think that I will do some paperwork. In the lab!" Assister shocks incredulous, but obligates the Rosa with assistance as the Mercy heads down.

After Captain captures you, Assister is roused into action. They transport you ashore, where your peace is constantly interrupted by some new Blind Ones tapping at you with scientific grey instruments. One day, in a flurry of bright green excitement, the Blind Ones shove a permanent rod into your body. Then they leave you alone to fold.
