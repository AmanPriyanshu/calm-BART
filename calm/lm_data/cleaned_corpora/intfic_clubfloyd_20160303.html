He told me about a series of emails you exchanged with him, in which you maintained having pushed a button in the shuttle just before the accident, which according to you was what caused the explosion. However, according to him, and the engineers under his orders, it is impossible that you could have pushed this button. [i may have reacted badly when I saw this email...] I'd like you to tell me what this memory means to you. It seems like [when i read it again, she wasn't as aggressive as I thought] it is something important, and that is likely carrying an emotional meaning   [but still, it's not very professional] that must be heavy to carry in your situation. I would have liked it if       [you don't force your patient to talk about something they don't want to talk about, right?] you had told me about it earlier; it is possible that working on this memory could help relieve your pain, and allow you to move forward. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it is very much possible that this memory does not correspond to an action that actually happened. The works of several psychologists have shown that memories can     [but is she telling the truth?] be constructed and modified by the brain in certain situations, including     [or are Klein and the others pulling the strings?] situations of post-traumatic stress disorder. In your case, it could represent an adaptation strategy that your brain adopted in response to this catastrophic event:  the fact that it was accidental, unforeseeable and without any logic may be too much to take in. Which does not mean that    ["just make up an explanation, Dr Peters"] you cannot function normally in other ways; it is a process that is very      ["something that sounds plausible, so that she gets that idea out of her head"] different from hallucinations or sensory malfunction, which are more worrying symptoms.

It is literally impossible, whatever you may say. The ship did not stop sending frequent backups of the black box, all through the trip. We have in our possession two copies of the ship's parameters when the accident happened: an incomplete one sent by the ship, and one coming directly from the actual black box that was recovered by the base's robots, which we received a few days after the accident. Hence, when I tell you that this button wasn't pushed, by you or anyone else, you must believe me; we have definite proof of what we're saying here. I do not doubt that you are sincere, but think a little, will you? You went through a horrendous crash that was most likely traumatizing; your brain may have some misfires these days, and if I tell you that I'm absolutely certain that you didn't do it, then you didn't do it. I imagine those are the repercussions of the accident. Take some rest and come back quickly to 100% of your abilities. We need you. Colonel Frank Klein.

Those working conditions are getting worse and worse, between unpaid hours of overtime and uncertainties surrounding the end-of-year bonus, as well as the pressure the company is putting its employees under. We already attempted to draw the attention of workers and the media to those working conditions two months ago, shortly before the catastrophe we all know about. Ever since then, the working conditions have not improved, and have even gotten worse. We report and criticize the following facts, which appeared within the last six weeks: - the constant changes in the workers' schedules; - the older model of shuttle being brought back in the factory without any complementary training given to the workers, which also puts new entrants at a disadvantage; - the contradictory orders and constant reconfiguration of the missions (order, content, durations, etc.), which betrays a clear lack of organization for the last six weeks; - inadequate psychological support and follow-up provided to employees. This also adds to our previous grievances, which were about the late payment or even sometimes the non-payment of overtime, or difficult schedules in the manufacturing unit when, as the recent events unfortunately show, ensuring both quality and security is paramount, and this requires to have qualified personnel be able to work under good conditions. We ask for our grievances to be heard by corporate management, and we wish to be given an interview with Mr Schwartz as soon as possible to discuss those points. Have a nice day, Your UAW representatives [good for them, i guess...] [pffff] [who's going to help me get out of this?] [Please press SPACE.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [ACTION] p

[interesting...] Those measurements are ones produced by sensors placed in the room where beds for the crew were set up. Our previous measurements indicate that you haven't been using this room for sleeping for a few weeks, but we still measured important traces of organic life, most notably heat and some breathing. [huh?] You must have been sleeping in that room last night and of course [i would never have done that!] it is totally fine, but the procedure is such that we have to inform you of any activity that's out of the ordinary. The other explanation, which is admittedly a bit more worrying, is that you were subject to a temporary sleepwalking episode during the night, which is possible. [sleepwalking? what next?] If this is the case, we ask you to inform your referring psychiatrist, Dr Peters.

[interesting...] Those measurements are ones produced by sensors placed in the room where beds for the crew were set up. Our previous measurements indicate that you haven't been using this room for sleeping for a few weeks, but we still measured important traces of organic life, most notably heat and some breathing. [huh?] You must have been sleeping in that room last night and of course [i would never have done that!] it is totally fine, but the procedure is such that we have to inform you of any activity that's out of the ordinary. The other explanation, which is admittedly a bit more worrying, is that you were subject to a temporary sleepwalking episode during the night, which is possible.
