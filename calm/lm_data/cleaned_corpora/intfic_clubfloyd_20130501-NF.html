"Telepathy," repeats the Concerto. "The real thing." "Some sort of organic radio, I presume," you say. "Or high bandwidth ultrasound. Or---" "No," says the Concerto impatiently. "It's not electromagnetic, nor a matter wave, nor chemical message-passing. I've even checked for gravity waves. This is something new. And you know what that means." You don't say the words. You don't have to. New physics. A new lead to the unsolveable mystery of the universe. New growth in the barren garden of science. "The planet is soaked in it," says the Concerto. "I've built some crude detectors --- just bits of animal brain inside NMR scanners --- and mapped the surface. The distribution's not even, but there's telepathic radiation everywhere." You reflect briefly on the Concerto's legendary lack of squeamishness. "Elysia is a perfect world," it continues. "Maybe too perfect. It may be too valuable to colonise. It may be too dangerous to colonise. I have no idea whether there's any effect on human minds." "You'll need some pretty hard evidence to persuade the exploitation team to stay in space when Elysia's right here," you say. "And I don't have it," says the Concerto. "There's an effect.

"You think they'll want to go ahead with full scale colonisation and only investigate this when they're down there." "Of course they will," says the Concerto. "The exploration team live in space. They'll be perfectly happy about staying in orbit for another decade to look into this --- most of them were going to stay here anyway. But the exploitation team won't tolerate that." "So what are you going to do?" you ask. "The exploitation team is still frozen, which means I hold their proxy votes," says the Concerto. "For important decisions I have to wake a representative sample, and this is important. This means I have to wake them. I have to, you understand?" The Concerto's own built-in safeguards limit how much it can bend the rules. "When?" you say. "Soon," the Concerto says. "I'll delay as long as I can. But I must wake them.

"You think they'll want to go ahead with full scale colonisation and only investigate this when they're down there." "Of course they will," says the Concerto. "The exploration team live in space. They'll be perfectly happy about staying in orbit for another decade to look into this --- most of them were going to stay here anyway. But the exploitation team won't tolerate that." "So what are you going to do?" you ask. "The exploitation team is still frozen, which means I hold their proxy votes," says the Concerto. "For important decisions I have to wake a representative sample, and this is important. This means I have to wake them. I have to, you understand?" The Concerto's own built-in safeguards limit how much it can bend the rules. "When?" you say. "Soon," the Concerto says. "I'll delay as long as I can. But I must wake them. In the mean time... we need more data. That's where you come in." "Ah," you say. "You want me to go and look and then tell you what to say." "Correct," says the Concerto.

Mats of grassy plants form little green islands here and there, some under the water.
