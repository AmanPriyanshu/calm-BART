[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. Walking home from school is mostly okay, except for one big problem: Every day you have to pass right by Mrs. Pepper's house.  She may not actually be a witch, but she sure acts like one.  She's ugly and crabby, and she seems to go out of her way to cause trouble for you. The time she came at you with the garden rake, swinging it like it was a giant claw ... you still shudder when you think of it. Last Friday was a new low.  You would never, ever skateboard in her driveway -- that would be practically suicidal.  But somehow when you got to the driveway your skateboard swerved, all by itself, as if somebody had put a spell on it.  And then you fell off. While you were picking grit out of the ugly scrape on your skinned elbow, Mrs. Pepper appeared out of nowhere and snatched up your skateboard!  She screeched something about rowdy children, trespassing, and needing to be taught a lesson.  She swung the skateboard at you like it was a bat, and then ran off with it, cackling.  Afterward you rang her doorbell for what seemed like an hour, begging her to give the skateboard back, and she wouldn't even come to the door. And now it's Monday afternoon, and here you are, on your way home from school as usual (but with no skateboard).  Just up ahead is Mrs. Pepper's driveway....

A paved walkway crosses it, leading from the sidewalk on the south up to the front porch on the north.  The driveway runs past the yard on the east side, and a tall fence guards what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree. The elf stops in the middle of the front yard and nods towards the tree.  "Do you see that poor bedraggled orange tree there?  It hasn't borne fruit in years, and may never again, unless someone else buys this house and nurtures it back to health.  But it's not quite dead, no indeed.  Watch closely now." He gestures at the nearest branch with his long, slim, gnarled fingers.  As you watch, a single bud bursts forth at the end of the branch.  At first no more than a tiny green nub, it swells rapidly. In a few seconds a plump, ripe orange is hanging from the branch. "Go ahead," says the elf.  "Pick the orange and enjoy it.  It's yours. Oh," he adds, handing you your skateboard, "you nearly forgot this." Before you can stammer your thanks -- before you can blurt out the dozen questions jostling in your head about what it's like being an elf, and where he came from, and whether you'll ever see him again -- the elf has somehow folded himself inward, like a fast-motion film of a growing plant when the film is run backwards.

[STATE] The elf accompanies you into the front yard. Front Yard The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except for a few hardy weeds.  A paved walkway crosses it, leading from the sidewalk on the south up to the front porch on the north.  The driveway runs past the yard on the east side, and a tall fence guards what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree. The elf stops in the middle of the front yard and nods towards the tree.  "Do you see that poor bedraggled orange tree there?  It hasn't borne fruit in years, and may never again, unless someone else buys this house and nurtures it back to health.  But it's not quite dead, no indeed.  Watch closely now." He gestures at the nearest branch with his long, slim, gnarled fingers.  As you watch, a single bud bursts forth at the end of the branch.  At first no more than a tiny green nub, it swells rapidly. In a few seconds a plump, ripe orange is hanging from the branch. "Go ahead," says the elf.  "Pick the orange and enjoy it.  It's yours. Oh," he adds, handing you your skateboard, "you nearly forgot this." Before you can stammer your thanks -- before you can blurt out the dozen questions jostling in your head about what it's like being an elf, and where he came from, and whether you'll ever see him again -- the elf has somehow folded himself inward, like a fast-motion film of a growing plant when the film is run backwards.  He shrinks and runs downward into the soil, and he's gone. (Your score has just increased by six points.) [ACTION] skate away [STATE] The story doesn't understand that command. [ACTION] east

[ACTION] west [STATE] The elf accompanies you into the front yard. Front Yard The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except for a few hardy weeds.  A paved walkway crosses it, leading from the sidewalk on the south up to the front porch on the north.  The driveway runs past the yard on the east side, and a tall fence guards what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree. The elf stops in the middle of the front yard and nods towards the tree.  "Do you see that poor bedraggled orange tree there?  It hasn't borne fruit in years, and may never again, unless someone else buys this house and nurtures it back to health.  But it's not quite dead, no indeed.  Watch closely now." He gestures at the nearest branch with his long, slim, gnarled fingers.  As you watch, a single bud bursts forth at the end of the branch.  At first no more than a tiny green nub, it swells rapidly. In a few seconds a plump, ripe orange is hanging from the branch. "Go ahead," says the elf.  "Pick the orange and enjoy it.  It's yours. Oh," he adds, handing you your skateboard, "you nearly forgot this." Before you can stammer your thanks -- before you can blurt out the dozen questions jostling in your head about what it's like being an elf, and where he came from, and whether you'll ever see him again -- the elf has somehow folded himself inward, like a fast-motion film of a growing plant when the film is run backwards.  He shrinks and runs downward into the soil, and he's gone. (Your score has just increased by six points.) [ACTION] inventory
