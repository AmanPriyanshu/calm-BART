Of course, then there's the chihuahua-sized centipede clinging to his neck and shoulder like a suckling infant. You still remember a time before familiars turned into a sort of shock fashion competition, though Ramos seems to have put an end to that; nobody cared to try harder than the giant centipede. The floorboards crack and pop underfoot. "Didn't half the wizards in this city get killed or worse last year?" You shrug. "They weren't my customers." "Still. Must have been some trouble."

So maybe a bunch of rich assholes are in the ground or in hospice care now. Maybe some of the people responsible were my customers. They're not any more." "You're only telling me this because you know I know." You give him a practiced glare. Chow takes a drink out of her glass. [ACTION] examine vest

[ACTION] examine table [STATE] The corner table is round, with a plush bench that wraps around it, fixed next to a window. Someone's phone squawks with a notification; nobody looks. "Come on, Ainsley," you say, getting plainly frustrated now. "Just tell me what this is about." He cocks his head and stares you down curiously, for a moment. And then he pulls out a slightly oversized phone. He flips through pictures of what looks like a blur smeared against the night sky; after a few of them, though, it resolves itself in your mind as a vaguely human figure, leaping across rooftops; or maybe flying. You can't quite tell. "You wouldn't happen to know anything about this, would you?" (You could INTERJECT here) [ACTION] examine pictures
