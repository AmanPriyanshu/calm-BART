[STATE] Many years ago, when the Iron Branch was passed down from king to king (instead of being a pile of rust in an overadorned urn), when dragons walked the earth (instead of flying about like the maniacs they are now), when Strongle was the God of Gods (instead of being, well, I think the polite term is "deposed")... back when all of that was taking place, magic had yet to be conquered by mere mortal man. What's that got to do with you, you ask?  Well, since you're an apprentice to one of those men who are trying to figure out how magic works, you get to do all the dirty deeds. A few weeks ago, Apaman (the loser you're apprenticed to) had sent you to recover the Hestron (one of the jewels in the Sceptre of Charlten). Despite your success on that mission, Apaman is not treating you any better.  Your best guess is that many of the Hestron's secrets remain hidden to him, and he's taking his frustrations out on the nearest convenient target. Now he's learnt about something that may help him unlock those secrets, and has sent you on another mission: to retrieve the sky rock from the north tower of Fossen Festning, a fortress built into the side of a mountain beside a large waterfall.  All you've brought with you is a dark cloak and an old grappling hook that Apaman was generous enough to loan to you.  All you need to bring out is the sky rock. Good luck with that.

Beneath the North Tower A dark tower rises high above you, lit dimly in the cloud-obscured moonlight. The sound of a waterfall is nearby but somewhat muted by the high walls of the fortress.

[ACTION] south [STATE] Central Courtyard Completely covered in cobblestones, the central courtyard is an enormous place, used for assembling the troops and greeting royalty. A large entryway is topped by an enormous stone arch.  It leads to the east where, hidden somewhere beyond the outer portcullis, Apaman awaits your return.  To the south and to the north rise the two watchtowers, and it is in the northern one that Apaman believes the star rock to be.  West is the entrance to the Festning itself, dug out of the rock of this mountain. Although you're hiding as best as you can in the shadows, it's dangerous to remain here long. [ACTION] south

[STATE] You sneak out under the portcullis, drawing absolutely no attention to yourself.  Apaman is there, ready to greet you. "Have you got it?" he asks excitedly. Wordlessly, you place the star rock into his eager, outstretched hand. Blinking once, twice in the moonlight, hardly daring to believe, he stares at it.  Finally, reality sets in and his gaze returns to you. "Let's go now," he says, gruffly.  He leads you back to the place you sarcastically call home.  You're not sure if the star rock really is the key to unlocking the Hestron like Apaman says, but you do feel a subtle difference in the way he's treating you.
