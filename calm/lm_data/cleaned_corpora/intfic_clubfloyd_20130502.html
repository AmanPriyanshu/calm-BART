If you missed Stagefright, I'm not surprised.  It was written in SmartBasic to run on the Coleco Adam computer (5 extra points if you remember the Adam - 10 if you owned one).  This version was completely recoded in AGT - which I highly recommend - and the plot redeveloped and rewritten make it more enjoyable. The object of the game is to find your way out of an old abandoned theater. Along the way you'll run into creaky catwalks, raging rivers, mini mazes, rogues, royalty, rats and a zoo keeper. You will endure puns, perils, pratfalls, word play, bad jokes, and a mild innuendo or two.  The screen will show a running account of your predicament, and you will enter your wishes on the keyboard.  For instance, if you are told that there is a wild man-eating kumquat behind the door, you might enter:  CLOSE THE DOOR. Phrase commands in a verb-noun-preposition-object order, such as THROW (verb) THE LITTLE BOOK (noun) AT (preposition) THE FLAMING DUCK (object).  DON'T use periods, question marks, etc. at the end of the sentence.  Commands can be combined and pronouns used for repeated references to the same thing:  LIGHT THE LAMP THEN GIVE IT TO THE BARTENDER.  If something doesn't seem to work, try re-phrasing it.

PUSH, PULL, TURN, PLAY, EXAMINE and READ any and everything.  There is no telling where I might have hidden some perverse little goodie.  Watch your score.  A jump upward means you're doing well.  A sudden drop probably means you just did something that will prevent you from completing the game.  SAVE the game frequently and you will be able to "backtrack" and try different strategies.

A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT The ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) is designed to allow a game designer/writer to create and play his/her own high-quality text adventure games.  Once created, these adventure games can be shared with and enjoyed by others -- even if they do not have a copy of the Adventure Game Toolkit themselves.  Using AGT the game developer can create two distinct levels of adventure games: STANDARD LEVEL games that require no programming experience (honestly!!), only a fertile imagination.  These Standard Level games only require that the game designer/writer generates the game using a word processor or text editor to describe the various locations, objects and results of actions that collectively make up the game. PROFESSIONAL LEVEL games that also make use of AGT's special adventure game metalanguage to create games as complex and rich as the game designer's imagination and prose style will allow.  These games should be technically comparable with the published text adventure games from firms like Infocom. FEATURES OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT AGT has a number of features that make it a very comprehensive adventure game creation product.  Some of these key features are: *     "Look and feel" of Infocom adventure games with similar screen layout and standard vocabulary and routines. *     Large standard vocabulary with potential to define many more words unique to a specific adventure.  Typical games can have a vocabulary of 500 words or more. *     Sophisticated parser that can understand (1) complex input commands including pronouns (IT, HIM, HER, THEM, MY and ITS), and (2) compound commands separated by AND or THEN or punctuation symbols, and (3) commands addressed to characters within the game.  Here are a few examples of commands AGT can handle with ease: GET THE FLASH LIGHT AND THEN SWITCH IT ON PUT ON THE CLOAK, THEN EXAMINE IT; READ ITS LABEL PLACE THE GREEN ROCK AND THE SMALL PEBBLE BEHIND THE TREE ENTER THE HOUSE; GET ALL; EXIT; SOUTH; SOUTH THEN DOWN SULU, SET A COURSE FOR ALPHA 14 SCOTTY, BEAM DOWN A TRICORDER AND THE QWERTY MODULE DROP THE FOOD, THE KEY AND THE BOTTLE THEN UNLOCK THE DOOR WITH THE BRASS KEY AND THEN LEAVE *     Function and cursor keys predefined to input frequently used commands and move directions. *     SCRIPT and UNSCRIPT commands to echo game output to printer. WHAT THE REVIEWERS HAVE SAID ABOUT THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT "Using the Adventure Game Toolkit, anyone with an ounce of imagination can create a text adventure game ... similar in layout and sophistication to those made by Infocom and other commercial developers." -- Donald B. Trivette in PC Magazine (January 17, 1989) "The Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT) acts as a compiler which allows for creating remarkably complex and sophisticated games in a fairly simple way .... AGT's parser reminds me of Infocom's." -- Scorpia in Computer Gaming World (February 1989) "If you have ever wondered what it is like to create your own adventure games, but didn't have the programming knowledge to do it, this product is for you .... The process is easy ... and you'll have hours of fun doing it." -- Resul DeMaria in Public Domain Software & Shareware "The Adventure Game Toolkit from Softworks ... provides all the tools you need to build your own text based adventure games ....

This version was completely recoded in AGT - which I highly recommend - and the plot redeveloped and rewritten make it more enjoyable. The object of the game is to find your way out of an old abandoned theater. Along the way you'll run into creaky catwalks, raging rivers, mini mazes, rogues, royalty, rats and a zoo keeper. You will endure puns, perils, pratfalls, word play, bad jokes, and a mild innuendo or two.  The screen will show a running account of your predicament, and you will enter your wishes on the keyboard.  For instance, if you are told that there is a wild man-eating kumquat behind the door, you might enter:  CLOSE THE DOOR.

DON'T use periods, question marks, etc. at the end of the sentence.  Commands can be combined and pronouns used for repeated references to the same thing:  LIGHT THE LAMP THEN GIVE IT TO THE BARTENDER.  If something doesn't seem to work, try re-phrasing it.

A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT The ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) is designed to allow a game designer/writer to create and play his/her own high-quality text adventure games.  Once created, these adventure games can be shared with and enjoyed by others -- even if they do not have a copy of the Adventure Game Toolkit themselves.  Using AGT the game developer can create two distinct levels of adventure games: STANDARD LEVEL games that require no programming experience (honestly!!), only a fertile imagination.  These Standard Level games only require that the game designer/writer generates the game using a word processor or text editor to describe the various locations, objects and results of actions that collectively make up the game. PROFESSIONAL LEVEL games that also make use of AGT's special adventure game metalanguage to create games as complex and rich as the game designer's imagination and prose style will allow.  These games should be technically comparable with the published text adventure games from firms like Infocom. FEATURES OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT AGT has a number of features that make it a very comprehensive adventure game creation product.  Some of these key features are: *     "Look and feel" of Infocom adventure games with similar screen layout and standard vocabulary and routines. *     Large standard vocabulary with potential to define many more words unique to a specific adventure.  Typical games can have a vocabulary of 500 words or more. *     Sophisticated parser that can understand (1) complex input commands including pronouns (IT, HIM, HER, THEM, MY and ITS), and (2) compound commands separated by AND or THEN or punctuation symbols, and (3) commands addressed to characters within the game.  Here are a few examples of commands AGT can handle with ease: GET THE FLASH LIGHT AND THEN SWITCH IT ON PUT ON THE CLOAK, THEN EXAMINE IT; READ ITS LABEL PLACE THE GREEN ROCK AND THE SMALL PEBBLE BEHIND THE TREE ENTER THE HOUSE; GET ALL; EXIT; SOUTH; SOUTH THEN DOWN SULU, SET A COURSE FOR ALPHA 14 SCOTTY, BEAM DOWN A TRICORDER AND THE QWERTY MODULE DROP THE FOOD, THE KEY AND THE BOTTLE THEN UNLOCK THE DOOR WITH THE BRASS KEY AND THEN LEAVE *     Function and cursor keys predefined to input frequently used commands and move directions. *     SCRIPT and UNSCRIPT commands to echo game output to printer. WHAT THE REVIEWERS HAVE SAID ABOUT THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT "Using the Adventure Game Toolkit, anyone with an ounce of imagination can create a text adventure game ... similar in layout and sophistication to those made by Infocom and other commercial developers." -- Donald B. Trivette in PC Magazine (January 17, 1989) "The Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT) acts as a compiler which allows for creating remarkably complex and sophisticated games in a fairly simple way .... AGT's parser reminds me of Infocom's." -- Scorpia in Computer Gaming World (February 1989) "If you have ever wondered what it is like to create your own adventure games, but didn't have the programming knowledge to do it, this product is for you .... The process is easy ... and you'll have hours of fun doing it." -- Resul DeMaria in Public Domain Software & Shareware "The Adventure Game Toolkit from Softworks ... provides all the tools you need to build your own text based adventure games ....

A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT The ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) is designed to allow a game designer/writer to create and play his/her own high-quality text adventure games.  Once created, these adventure games can be shared with and enjoyed by others -- even if they do not have a copy of the Adventure Game Toolkit themselves.  Using AGT the game developer can create two distinct levels of adventure games: STANDARD LEVEL games that require no programming experience (honestly!!), only a fertile imagination.  These Standard Level games only require that the game designer/writer generates the game using a word processor or text editor to describe the various locations, objects and results of actions that collectively make up the game. PROFESSIONAL LEVEL games that also make use of AGT's special adventure game metalanguage to create games as complex and rich as the game designer's imagination and prose style will allow.  These games should be technically comparable with the published text adventure games from firms like Infocom. FEATURES OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT AGT has a number of features that make it a very comprehensive adventure game creation product.  Some of these key features are: *     "Look and feel" of Infocom adventure games with similar screen layout and standard vocabulary and routines. *     Large standard vocabulary with potential to define many more words unique to a specific adventure.  Typical games can have a vocabulary of 500 words or more. *     Sophisticated parser that can understand (1) complex input commands including pronouns (IT, HIM, HER, THEM, MY and ITS), and (2) compound commands separated by AND or THEN or punctuation symbols, and (3) commands addressed to characters within the game.  Here are a few examples of commands AGT can handle with ease: GET THE FLASH LIGHT AND THEN SWITCH IT ON PUT ON THE CLOAK, THEN EXAMINE IT; READ ITS LABEL PLACE THE GREEN ROCK AND THE SMALL PEBBLE BEHIND THE TREE ENTER THE HOUSE; GET ALL; EXIT; SOUTH; SOUTH THEN DOWN SULU, SET A COURSE FOR ALPHA 14 SCOTTY, BEAM DOWN A TRICORDER AND THE QWERTY MODULE DROP THE FOOD, THE KEY AND THE BOTTLE THEN UNLOCK THE DOOR WITH THE BRASS KEY AND THEN LEAVE *     Function and cursor keys predefined to input frequently used commands and move directions. *     SCRIPT and UNSCRIPT commands to echo game output to printer.
