It was developed in around 1949 after the formation of the People's Republic of China and replaced the Wade-Giles system, which was a far less accurate way of representing spoken Chinese sounds. The Wade-Giles method did not employ tone numbers, which tells the reader how to pronounce the word accurately by altering the pitch. Pinyin manages to do this however, by the use of numbers. A number is placed after each syllable, which indicates the pitch in which it is to be spoken. Discussing intricacies of the exact pronounciation of the different consonants and vowels is beyond the scope of this game and it is left up to the player's own discretion to find out more - however the tone numbers are as follows: 1: A long, even, high-level tone. 2: A rising tone, starting at natural level and rising to the high tone. Fairly short. 3: A long, falling, rising tone. Starting at natural level, falling to low level, rising to highest level. 4: A short, falling tone, beginning at highest level, falling to low level. 5 (or numberless): A short, soft tone at normal speaking pitch. Also known as the Neutral tone. Pinyin with tone numbers is currently set to: OFF. [ACTION] pinyin on
