You try not to think about Male. It's just a chicken, after all. Plenty more where that came from. *** You are a monster *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command? > UNDO The Barn [Previous turn undone.] > 2 The farmer looks disappointed. "Really? I coulda sworn it had the swagger of a cockerel. Well, I guess ya'll be givin' me plenty of eggs, little chicken." He picks up Male from the table, and turns towards you. "Let's get to work. Plenty more where that came from." With that, he throws the gate wide open, and leaves the barn. You think about Male, and smile. It'll be several weeks at least before the secondary sex characteristics start becoming apparent, even to the untrained eye of the farmer. Several weeks of life for little Male. Not much, but better than nothing. *** You made a difference *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command? [ACTION] wait [STATE]  Time passes. [ACTION] again
