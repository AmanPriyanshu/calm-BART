But he hasn't noticed me yet. Barely able to conceal the joy in my voice, I step over to the edge of the platform and shout "Daniel Maguire! What the FUCK are you doing here?" And he notices me and shouts "Alex Moran, would you ever shut the FUCK up, you cross-eyed WANKER!" And I reply "Go FUCK yourself, ASSHOLE!" and he replies "Suck me off, you BENT BASTARD!". And the two of us run up and down the platforms, joyously shouting abuse at each other across three lines of track. And all the stuck-up grannies and biddies and ghastly yacht-clubbers waiting at the station stare at us as if we are mad.

He is without doubt the most vain, pompous, self-obsessed asshole I have ever met. God, that guy is in love with himself. He absolutely adores every inch of his own body. He has to surround himself continually with an entourage of fawning admirers. And this year, he became a member of the St. Enda's under-18 rugby team. So, if there was ever any doubt about it, he is now officially an asshole. Gordon turns around and faces the room. "Come on now lads, wake yourselves up, come on now," he says in a thick country accent. He doesn't usually have a thick country accent. He's just making fun of Declan the Seminarian. You'll meet Declan later. Gordon is greeted by groaning, some of it from me. The sink is where we spit all our slooshed-out toothpaste each morning. It's covered in limescale, and the plumbing underneath is exposed. Both hot and cold taps produce a weak, tepid stream of water, but at least they don't drip all night. Above the sink is a mirror. "Ah, I see Mr Alex Moran is already awake," says Gordon in his normal voice, which is deep and terribly pompous. "And what about Mr Wayne Treacy?" I can't see myself in the mirror from my bed. I can, however, see a most uninteresting part of the side wall. "And what about Mr Wayne Treacy?" says Gordon again, raising his voice. Wayne stirs in his bed.

"He'd have to sleep next to you then, Wayne," says Gordon. He is smoothing shaving cream all over his face. He tends to spend way too long doing this, caressing his sleek jawline again and again.

He often goes round the back of the school to be with all the smokers, and tries to talk with them about girls, sport, pop music - subjects with which he is hopelessly out of touch.

I know I'm seventeen and all, but, to tell the truth, I haven't ever been out with a girl before. I haven't even spoken to a girl for so long. What will I say? What will I do? I know I'm going to make an absolute asshole of myself. Girls frighten the shit out of me, to be honest. I remember when I was fourteen, when we all went back to school after the summer holidays, and everyone was suddenly talking about girls. And not in the way we'd usually snigger - everyone was now talking about them in a serious way. Girls they kissed, girls they fancied, meeting girls in discos. And I remember feeling bewildered, nauseated - I really didn't want any of this to be happening. It's not that I was jealous of anyone - I wasn't - I just didn't even want them to be interested in that sort of thing. It was like being suddenly thrust into an uncertain, dangerous world - a world of aftershave, hairiness and croaking voices, a world of constant worrying, a world of acne, Adidas and Calvin Klein. And I didn't want any of it. I wanted to be twelve again, when I was innocent and free, and happy. I wanted to be twelve again and be with Daniel, and we'd roam through forests and climb rocks and explore the countryside, and everything would be full of mystery and magic. And we'd sneak into a hay-barn and tell each other stories and he'd teach me bad language. And we'd shout out swear-words at the top of our voices, where no-one would hear us. "Go fuck yourself, asshole!" he'd say, and I'd say "Fuck you, you bent bastard!" and we'd go on like that, shouting for ages, and we could say anything we wanted, and do anything we wanted, and we didn't worry about a single thing in the whole fucking world. . . . I go down to the dining hall for breakfast, and sit at a table on my own. Dining Hall (on the chair) The dining hall is in one of the newer buildings of St. Enda's College. It's a functional, spartan room, full of windows which make it appear larger than it really is. The whole place seems to have a permanent smell of mashed potato. The rows of tables and chairs are always half-empty at this time in the morning. On the table is my breakfast. St. Enda's has little to offer in the way of breakfasts. We have a choice of either soggy cornflakes, soggy muesli or soggy toast. I chose the soggy toast. I also have some orange juice. [ACTION] taste juice

What is it about Ferdia that provokes such a reaction in me? I often think about this, for on the surface he can appear to be quite friendly. But underneath this friendliness is something more sinister. Ferdia is constantly seeking attention - demanding attention. With every word, every gesture, Ferdia screams "Look at me! Look at how great I am! Look at me!" And whenever we speak, it's as if Ferdia is demanding that I acknowledge all his perfections and concede his superiority in all things. So most of the time he feels less like a friend and more like a leech, drawing all of my attention, sucking away at my self esteem.

A real friend, not a parasite like Ferdia. Someone with whom I could be myself, someone with whom I could relax, someone with whom I could share my hopes and dreams. His name was Daniel Maguire. I first met him when I was ten years old, before I went to St. Enda's, when I was going to the local primary school out in the country. He was the new boy in class, and for no apparent reason he was very nice to me. We became friendly, and pretty soon we became inseparable. Whenever we were together, it was so special! I remember the summers we had... I can honestly say that the only times I felt free, the only times I felt liberated from all my inhibitions, were the times I spent with Daniel. We didn't have any secrets from each other. I didn't have to feign interest in anything just to please him, I didn't feel the need to impress him with long words and insincere feelings, I didn't have to be anything other than myself. But I know my parents weren't too fond of him. They were always trying to get me to play with some ghastly yacht-club children, and I don't think they liked some of the language I picked up from Daniel, either. Somehow I began to see him less and less. Then, when I was thirteen, disaster struck. I was packed off to St. Enda's, and Daniel went to some other secondary school. And after that, I didn't get to see him at all. . . . Shortly after that, Daniel sent me a letter. It was a very funny letter, describing some events and people at his new school. It was like a flash of the old Daniel, the one who used to tell funny stories in a hay-barn. It cheered me up no end during the misery of St. Enda's, let me tell you. I knew I had to reply, and it had to be a really well-written and funny letter, too. God, I tried so often to write that letter. Practically every night I would stare at a page that was blank except for the words "Dear Daniel" at the top. I just couldn't think of anything to say. "Just be yourself," I kept thinking, "And write down whatever comes into your head." But nothing came into my head. A few weeks passed, and I still hadn't written a reply. And then I couldn't think of any excuses for my lateness. The longer it went on, the more ashamed I became about the delay, and the harder it was to write. I must have read and re-read Daniel's letter fifty times, looking for inspiration. I still have that letter. I still haven't replied. . . . I often dream of a reunion with Daniel. I think about how it would happen - whether it would be in our old school out in the country, or in the hay-barn where we used to go, or maybe just passing on the street. But if I ever do meet Daniel again, I hope I'll be standing on the platform of a railway station - a miserable, damp railway station, where all the seats are taken by stuck-up grannies and biddies and ghastly yacht-clubbers. And while waiting for the train, which is taking ages, I'll peer over to the opposite platform, and notice a familiar figure. Daniel! Barely able to conceal the joy in my voice, I'll step over to the edge of the platform and shout "Daniel Maguire! What the FUCK are you doing here?" And he'll notice me and shout "Alex Moran, would you ever shut the FUCK up, you cross-eyed WANKER!" And I'll reply "Go FUCK yourself, ASSHOLE!" and he'll reply "Suck me off, you BENT BASTARD!". And the two of us will run up and down the platforms, joyously shouting abuse at each other across three lines of track. And all the stuck-up grannies and biddies and ghastly yacht-clubbers waiting at the station will stare at us as if we are mad, but we'll carry on, running up and down, screaming profanities, and let the rest of the world GO FUCK ITSELF! . . . Well, another crap day in school. Ferdia has been pissing me off all day. He kept on droning on and on about his science project and all his 'theories' and 'breakthroughs'.

Quay Everything here is so peaceful, so beautiful - why have I never noticed it before? Raindrops dance on the river bay beneath my feet. Seagulls play in the air above me. Old fishing boats sway gently with the lapping of the water. And the air - I always thought the salt air was foul before, but now it seems so fresh, so clean, so pure! [ACTION] jump
