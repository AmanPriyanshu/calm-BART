Too bad he's not the patron saint of shipwrecks. Better take it along." You fold it up carefully. "Why did they martyr him?" you ask. "Well, between the Human Catholic Church and the Rat Catholic Church there are some differences in the rules—such as, according to the human church, you're not allowed to declare yourself a saint. It's considered presumptuous. But we did get a tapestry out of it." You stuff the tapestry of Saint Incertus into the sack. [ACTION] fore

[STATE]  You pull the flag out of the box and unfold it: the design is a yellow cross on a red field. "Whose flag is this?" you ask your captain. "I dunno. I think Denmark? Anyway, it's useless. Toss it." You nod, and throw the flag somewhere where it won't get in the way. The flag that was underneath is striped. [ACTION] again [STATE]  You unfold the striped flag to see the entire design. It's a blue stripe, a white stripe, a red stripe, a white stripe, and a blue stripe. "That's the Russian flag," Verdeterre explains. "You're holding it upside down." It's just a Russian flag anyway, so you toss it. The next flag in the box has a red X on it. [ACTION] again

"That's the Swiss flag," Verdeterre says, but then he stops himself: "No, wait. The Swiss flag is a white cross on red. So this one, I guess, is for... the Swiss navy." The captain seems put off a bit at himself, so you throw away the offending flag. At the bottom of the flag box is an old tapestry. [ACTION] take tapestry

[ACTION] take tapestry [STATE]  You pull out the tapestry and unfold it. It depicts a rat in clerical garb lying on his back, his stomach pierced by the spear of a human paladin. The rat's fingers are either raised in pious benediction or twisted in pain. "Hey, that's the Martyrdom of Saint Incertus!" says Verdeterre. "He's the patron saint of the pursued, I think. Too bad he's not the patron saint of shipwrecks. Better take it along." You fold it up carefully. "Why did they martyr him?" you ask. "Well, between the Human Catholic Church and the Rat Catholic Church there are some differences in the rules—such as, according to the human church, you're not allowed to declare yourself a saint. It's considered presumptuous. But we did get a tapestry out of it." You stuff the tapestry of Saint Incertus into the sack. [ACTION] take sextant
