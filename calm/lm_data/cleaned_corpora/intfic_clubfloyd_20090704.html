[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. The IBS Radio Network presents... Sam Fortune - Private Investigator A transcribed drama filled with suspense and adventure by Steve Blanding  (You may type "HELP" at any time for hints, credits or just general information about this game.) Tonight's drama: The Case of the Missing Playboy! Sponsored by Muskrat Cigarettes. Folks, do you know that four out of five doctors recommend Muskrat Cigarettes for their patients who smoke? It's true! That's because Muskrat Cigarettes have been clinically proven to taste better, smoke smoother, and improve respiratory health! So the next time you crave a good smoke, choose Muskrat Cigarettes! You'll be glad you did. And now for Act I of tonight's drama.... It was an afternoon much like any other afternoon. I was alone in my office. It seems I was always alone. Business had been slow. I was reduced to practicing my witty banter with my friends Jack and Daniel. Unfortunately for me, they weren't very much for conversation. We'd been conversing just long enough that I was beginning to feel that my banter really WAS witty. But not so much that I was beginning to think they'd talk back. Sam's Office You are Sam Fortune, a private investigator who, at the moment, has very little to investigate. Your office is on the fifth floor of a crummy old office building in the lower east side. There is a single dingy window in the west wall, directly opposite the only door. The sun streaming throught the Venetian blinds traces bars across the desk that sits in the middle of the room.  Bars like the bars of a prison cell. On the wooden desk are a bottle of whiskey and a telephone. A battered old filing cabinet stands in the corner. An old desk chair sits behind the desk. A plain guest chair is strategically placed in front of the desk. [ACTION] examine me

You immediately recognize two of them as your friends Mickey Boy and Weasel Face Flynn. You assume the third must be Mr. Gabriele himself. Tony points a .38 at you and says, "Mr. Fortune, I grow tired of this little game you've been playing. I would have thought that by now you would have learned not to go where you are not wanted." "Yeah, well, I've never been too good at that." "That's really too bad. Mickey Boy, Flynn, take Mr. Fortune for a ride in the boat. I've had enough of his meddling." "Sure, boss." Before you have time to react, Mickey Boy clubs the back of your head with his pistol and you drop like a sack of beans. Please press SPACE to continue. It's a pity that Sam wasn't awake for that early morning boat ride into the middle of the harbor. The sunrise that morning was particularly impressive. Unfortunately, the anchor tied to his feet and the water in his lungs made sure that he would never see it. Ladies and gentlemen.

Tony and his two thugs come running out of the office only to find five large policemen waiting for them.  It didn't take but a moment for them to realize that they were outnumbered. The jig was up. I stepped out of the shadows and said, "Officers, I'm glad to see you. I think you'll want to take a look at what's in those crates over there. I think you'll discover that Mr. Gabriele and his stooges here have just received a large supply of narcotics. The other night Bob Watterson overheard them discussing this shipment and he must have been foolish enough to mention it to Ginger Andrews. She told Tony and he decided that they needed to shut him up. When I started digging around, they saw an opportunity to get rid of him permanently and pin it on me." Suddenly a dark shape with flowing red hair ran into the warehouse and threw her arms around me. "Sam! You're OK!" "Yeah, sweetheart. I'm just swell. You did good. You and Clancy's boys showed up just in time." I bent over and gave Irene a long passionate kiss. "Baby, we make a pretty good team. What say we blow this joint and go find somewhere to get better acquainted?" "Yes, Sam. I think I'd like that very much."

The stairs that lead back to the waiting area are behind you, to the south. You can barely make out a figure on the central platform which you hope must be Irene.
