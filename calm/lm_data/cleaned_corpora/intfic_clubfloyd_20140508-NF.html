If it wasn't for Jenny, he would have probably called in sick. His queasy stomach has settled, but his head pounds, and he has difficulty focusing his itchy eyes. This type of wake-up call was supposed to have ended when he had graduated from college and swore off the booze. That was the year his father, a vice cop, drove head-on into a truck, killing himself and his wife, Stephen's mother. They had just stumbled away from their wedding anniversary celebration at the bar where, twenty years previous, Stephen's father had stuffed dollar bills in his future wife's g-string. Perhaps alcohol abstinence has prevented some of the physical decline associated with age and detective work in a large city; Stephen looks generally the same as he did during his college years, with a few creases around the eyes and gray hairs that appeared during and after the divorce, when his ex decided to take his daughters to New York with her. Cochone's legs begin to ache, and he shifts in his seat to releive the pressure. — [ACTION] inventory

If no slots are available to the right but there is an empty slot to the left, the tracks shift backward. If the Sequence is already full, the track in the last slot is lost; u can also put a track number first or second or third, etc. PLAY TRACKS or PLAYLIST or SEQUENCE: plays all the tracks in whatever you specified; "tracks" will play all the unslotted tracks PLAY or P [a track]: accepts track names or numbers unslotted tracks plays tracks that are not in the Sequence in their number order PLAY TRACKS or SEQUENCE or PLAYLIST RANDOMLY: if "tracks" is specified, all the tracks not in the Sequence will play  randomly RENAME [a track] track or track in the specified slot forward or backward the specified number along the Sequence if there are empty sklots to fill; if an empty slot is specified, the specified number of slots forward or back will be emptied; it will seperate tracks  if the specified track is next to another track SHUFFLE PLAYLIST or SEQUENCE: rearranges the tracks but doesn't play them SUMMARIZE [a track]: allows you to write a brief description of the track; if you play a track with a summary and summaries is switched on, your description will be printed, instead of playing the track SWITCH SUMMARIES or SWITCH ON or OFF SUMMARIES: When summaries are switched on, your descriptions of the tracks will be printed.

[ACTION] musical cues [STATE]  The songs I had to choose from for the 2014 ShuffleComp: Courtney Barnett "Avant Gardener" Yosi Horikawa "Wandering" Jacques Dutronc "Il Est Cinq Heures Paris S'eveille" The Animals "House of the Rising Sun" Super Furry Animals "Venus and Serena" Chris Powell "Hot Dog" The Golden Filter "Solid Gold" Red Fang "Wires" Several months before ShuffleComp came along in April 2014, I was wondering how a work of interactive fiction could be based on the found footage genre of filmmaking. I wasn't planning on entering the competition, because I was afraid I couldn't develop and implement a game within the time alotted. But, a few days before the playlists were to be submitted, I thought about how a game could be constructed like a CD, with individual tracks making up a whole album. The interface could be much like a CD player. Then I realized this fit well with my found footage idea, and sequitur followed from there. Of the songs on the playlist I received, "House of the Rising Sun" and "Solid Gold" had the greatest influence on sequitur. The Asian brothel and Cochone's gambling were inspired by The Animals' song, as was the prison (which some music critics think is the real "House of the Rising Sun"). The band name, The Animals, also inspired the naming of the main characters, and Jenny's dogs are named after members of the band. Because of "Solid Gold," i added the chemical/alchemical aspect of the story. References are made throughout the game to elements — the names of the band members are abbreviated names for the noble gases argon, neon, and xenon, for example. "Hot Dog" and, to a lesser extent, "Il Est Cinq Heures Paris S'eveille" also influenced sequitur. Most obviously, Cochone's favorite food, the name of the band, and the vegetarian references were inspired by the former, and the Fench element was included because of the latter. This is just a sample of how these songs shaped the game; you'll likely find other similarities. I chose these songs based on listening to them, not on their videos. Only after sequitur was being developed did I go through the videos. As it turns out, those for "Wandering" and "Wires" share some themes with the game, but these similarities are coincidental. I enjoyed all of the songs on my playlist — six of the eight were new to me. Listen to all of them then turn on the radio. After all, the word "music" is derived from the Greek "muse."

Cochone has pieced together parts of her story from other cops. She hasn't always needed the wheels and cane. She had walked the beat when she joined the force, but her career path had veered off course after her drunken boyfriend found her in his house with another guy. His response was bone shattering. Jenny was smart enough to leave Mr. Fists and join the IT department, advancing it into the 21st century with innovation that would make NASA envious. Cochone thinks that she doesn't look like a computer geek. She is slim, and she wears a stylish sleeveless shirt and skirt, which shows off most of her tanned legs. Her hair also exudes fashion and flash: long, copper, and curled at the bottom. And there's her rack, too. But she isn't pretty. Her facial features are pinched, and her lips are reddened to a shade that even vice cops would consider excessive. — [ACTION] play sequence [STATE] — > PLAY SEQUENCE Cochone tries to concentrate, to move.

The gang then splits up; Neo, Nickell, and Xeno explore outside ("Backyard" and "Dead Zone") while Argo and Salt scout the rooms for somewhere to set up their equipment ("Diary"). Neo and Xeno find Kiku ("Chrysanthemum") while Nickell places a camera outside to record the backyard ("Time Lapse"). Argo, Neo, and Xeno pass Nickell, who is entering the house, on their way to see Salt in the kitchen ("Locked Door"). Salt investigates the ring (which Neo found while urinating in the trees) and the diary contents ("Google"). Neo and Nickell decide to eat outside, where the latter sets up his audio recorder ("Sound Test"), and Neo discovers the injured squirrel has been exposed to the gold powder ("Squirrel Trap"). Despite exposure, the squirrel seems healthy. Salt convinces Argo and Xeno to break into the basement through the boarded-up windows, and they are attacked by Kiku's daughter ("Basement"). The startled blackbirds are caught by the audio recorder, which also picks up the arrival of the terrorists, Nickell retrieving the oar, and Kiku's daughter leaving in the boat with one of the terrorists ("Diary"). Neo has already returned to the house and tries to help Xeno, but the terrorists arrive ("Fight"). Xeno escapes, but Neo and Nickell are killed. Xeno runs up to Kiku's room where Kiku helps her escape out the window ("Escape"). The terrorists and Kiku's daughter decide to burn the laboratory before leaving ("Torching").
