NEVERMORE is a work of Interactive Fiction by Nate Cull (culln@xtra.co.nz), written for the 2000 IF Competition, and based very loosely on the poem "The Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe. All box quotes are from the www.eserver.org text of the poem. Everything else is original, bears no relation to any known literary work or historical fact, and is quite probably indicative of some deep unresolved psychological trauma in the author's childhood.
