[STATE]  You study the foundations for a while, working out where the point of greatest weakness is, and place the dynamite there. [ACTION] hit gong [STATE]  The gong resounds with a mournful note that echoes throughout the castle. The gaunt soldiers that guard the Great Hall leave their posts to file slowly into the watchtower.

They shamble and crawl over its mouldy flagstone, picking at the carcasses chained to the walls. [ACTION] light dynamite [STATE]  You light the fuse and quickly make your exit from the cave. Scant seconds later the dynamite explodes and the nearby foundations fold up like a concertina. With a low rumble, the watchtower collapses into a pile of broken stone and dust, forever changing the skyline of Amaranth. Those few of the Prince's terrible soldiers to escape are in no state to return to their posts. The sun sets over Amaranth and those few citizens out of doors scurry back to their homes. You retire to the local inn. Something descends on the village from the castle with the flapping of leathery wings. Come morning, another poor soul is found pale, weak and proclaiming his love for the Red Prince. [ACTION] examine tapestries

[ACTION] examine tapestries [STATE] These faded tapestries depict battles whose combatants and outcomes have been obscured by age. > TALK TO PRINCE "Oh... you were expecting me to be perturbed that you intend to kill me? You think, perhaps, that you're the first to try? But that is not so. I have bested far greater warriors than you. Much braver souls have begged me for mercy. Whole armies have been broken to my will. Yes, carry out your futile designs. And the less you bore me, the less I shall make you suffer." [ACTION] wipe smile off his face

He easily evades your clumsy attack, at first, before you find a grace and prowess you had no idea you possessed. You duck beneath fingers wielded like talons and drive the silver sword through his heart. With a prolonged death rattle, he crumples into his chair. The corpse of the Red Prince bears a strange and terrible smile. > X CORPSE In truth, he does not seem to have changed much from when he was alive. The corpse of the Red Prince moves with the slightest twitch. [ACTION] kick corpse
