Most of them were gone, as was the palace's roof, ripped away. All that remained of the upper floor of the villa was a curious island of orichalcum-flecked ceramic tiles, cracking in the sunlight. Even then, this little patch of opulence had been ransacked, more than once, by various desperate bands – and later, desperate individuals. A pile of ash, the remains of a campfire, marred the tiles on the floor. The only furniture that remained was a lectern made of gold, rendered worthless by the calamity.

This depiction's presence in the apartments was unusual; it suggested a man who was greatly invested in the discipline of his slaves. Over the years, the lashing of slaves to the lectern had made it a focus of fear and loathing for the servants in the manor; the master had liked to keep such a reminder close to him. Leather straps, bloodied and rough, still adorned it. [ACTION] down [STATE]  Half a Foyer This rich foyer had been floored with brilliant marble tiles and draped with silks. One of the grand columns along its side had toppled, preventing movement into most of the palace complex. Holes in the wall – hard to tell if they had been intentional passages – led north and south, outside. A hidden door in the west had become a jagged hole. And a collapsed staircase still allowed an unsteady climb to an upstairs room. [ACTION] south

But she found within it only a dried fountain, and a lawn that had become overgrown with grass. The grass, in turn, was a matted patch of drying hay, caked with dust and ash, waiting to catch fire in the constant sun. A breach in the land was still open to the east; to the north, she could see a jagged passage into the remains of a palace. The fountain was long drained of water, but it still stood. [ACTION] east

But then, orichalcum proved too soft, too. She saw a mess of green-gold tiles, stopped mid-spin, where the street used to be. All around her were the husks of crumbled buildings. The maw of a tunnel opened up to the southwest; the square was back southeast. [ACTION] examine tunnel

The land's breaking has reduced the gilded façades of the shops that surrounded the square to rubble and ashes. Breaks in the surrounding ring of debris were open to the northwest and east. A rush of turbulent water prevented passage to the east. She could also see her makeshift raft here. [ACTION] enter raft
