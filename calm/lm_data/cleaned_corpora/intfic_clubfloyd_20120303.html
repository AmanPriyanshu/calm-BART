[STATE] The Bar A man dressed in an odd-looking black hooded robe sits on one of the barstools, drinking a foamy beer.  Besides him, no one else is in the bar.  Behind the bar, the bartender is nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he is taking a break.  Perhaps, that is why the bar is so empty.  To the north, vacationers gamble away their money in the casino.  A corridor to the west leads to the grand hall. The old man extends a single hairy finger outside of his robe and beckons to you.  "You!", he calls in a low, raspy voice.  "Come have a seat.  I must tell you something important." The old man snakes a strong, thin, gnarly arm out of his cloak and takes a long drink of his ale.  Then the arm disappears back into his cloak.  But although you could have sworn you saw the frothy amber liquid emptying into his mouth, you notice the mug is still full to the brim. [ACTION] examine man [STATE] The old man sits at the bar.  His robe shimmers strangely.  Although he is obviously very old, his posture is straight, and he appears strong and healthy. His face is wrinkled and is shrouded in the shadow of his hood. His eyes are deepset but stare penetratingly out from between his wrinkles.  Great wisdom seems to emanate from them.  His nose is thin and bends slightly to the left.  His lips are almost hidden within the shadows of his cloak.  You can just barely make out the top of a long, thick, grey beard that extends from just below his lower lip down into his robe.

I must tell you something." [ACTION] sit [STATE] (the barstool) "Listen to my words!" "I am a powerful wizard.  I am aligned with the forces of good. Another powerful wizard is trapped in a magical location on this ship. He is aligned with the forces of evil.  The island to which ship travels has come into alignment with a place of great evil magical power located in another universe. When the ship reaches the island, the evil wizard will slowly accrue power from the power source in the other universe.  If the ship stays at the island long enough, he will accrue enough power to break free from the magical forces that hold him prisoner.  Then he will conquer the entire earth and enslave the entire human race. "There is only one way that this can be prevented.  Three power crystals are located on this ship, all on different decks from each other.  You must find them.  In order to invoke their power, you must hold them in your hands; you cannot put them in any sort of container. After you have found them, taking them to the location of the portal to the evil wizard's prison will cause the area to be illuminated in a bright pink aura.  You must go up from that location several times to reach the evil wizard's prison.  You must bring the three power crystals to the place where the evil wizard is before he accrues enough power to break free.  The crystals will cause him to be destroyed. "You are probably wondering why I don't gather these crystals myself since I am such a powerful wizard.  The problem is that this is something only you can do.  You have a special aura about you. Because of this aura, you can gather the crystals.  Because of this aura, you can use them to defeat the evil wizard.  I cannot cast any spells to assist you; if I do, the crystals will be destroyed. "I can, however, help you by giving you two magical items:  an evil detector and some magic eyedrops.  The evil detector will tell you how much evil power the evil wizard has absorbed from the evil power source.  If it reads 275 or higher, he will have enough power to escape from his confines.  The magic eyedrops will allow you to see the power crystals, which are normally invisible to ordinary people." The wizard pulls something out of the depths of his cloak that looks very similar to a digital wristwatch and puts it around your wrist.  "This is the evil detector", he says. The wizard takes a spray bottle out of the depths of his robe and sprays a liquid from it into your eyes.  It stings for a while, but after the stinging goes away, you feel as if your vision is somehow more acute.  "Those were the magic eyedrops," he says. "Before you go, I must warn you of one thing," says the wizard. "The special aura that surrounds you is a mixed blessing.  It does allow you to collect the crystals and defeat the evil wizard.  Its drawback, however, is that if you come in complete alignment with an evil power source in another universe, you will die.  This means that you must not go out onto the island. "Oh, one more thing:  You're probably thinking that this is a ridiculous scenario, that surely since I am such a powerful wizard I can do this myself.  To help you understand the situation better, I will remind you of a story you have probably heard before, that of Aladdin.  In that story, a powerful sorcerer wanted to get a magical lamp out of a cave.  However, only Aladdin could enter the cave.  It didn't matter that the sorcerer was a powerful sorcerer.  Only Aladdin could enter the cave. "If you want to hear all this again, ask me about the evil wizard." Your score just went up 5 points! Okay, you're now sitting on the barstool.
