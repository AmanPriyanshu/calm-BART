John pulls out a sheet of crumpled paper and a lighter and sets the paper ablaze.  "My drop form," he says, looking at the paper.  "I'm not failing Psych 1 this semester.  I'm going to ace the final!" Surprised, you slip on your scouring pad and nearly fall face first into the tub.  "*What*?  You're actually going to *finish* that class?"

I don't care if I've got a D minus in it so far!" For the last two years, you and John have shared a tiny apartment north of campus.

As you couldn't find another apartment, you've been praying for release ever since, if not by death, at least by John's graduating and leaving.

John tries to write some notes on a piece of paper, messes up, and, in a fit of frustration, crumples up the paper and throws it to the floor.

Your bedroom is to the south, behind an open door, while John's room is to the north, beyond a closed door.  The bathroom can be reached by going east through an open door. You hear a knock on the front door.  You rush to the living room, knowing that trouble has arrived, but are too late!  The door flies open with a crash! There is an explosion of confetti around you, and a paper noisemaker licks impudently at your face.  When the paper clears, you see standing at the door John's four troublesome friends, Alice, Bob, Carl, and Evan!  "Hi-yah, John!"  greets Alice, their leader.  "Looks like we're not too late for the party!"  She doffs her conical party hat and strides over to John's desk.  "Say, is that a psychology book you're studying?  Really hitting the books now, are ya?"  She grins as she puts down some snacks and a radio blaring obnoxious music, and parks herself and Carl on the floor.  Evan immediately goes to you and starts speaking about trivia, and Bob wanders around drunkenly. It's going to be an even longer night than you imagined... [ACTION] north

[ACTION] north [STATE] You can't leave your apartment now!  Not when you still have to keep an eye on John! John wails to you, "Could you help quiz me?  Please?" Carl takes out a candy bar, strips the cellophane off of it, crumples it into a neat, compact ball, and tosses it absent-mindedly in the direction of the bedrooms. Alice breaks out a pack of cards and plays a hand of hearts with Carl. Bob, thinking that he's walking in a straight line, toes a path more akin to the outline of a Picasso painting than anything else. Going into deep financial detail, Evan gives a discourse on the rise and fall of Infocom, Inc.  He also mentions how much he liked that little robot Floyd. [ACTION] east

[ACTION] north [STATE] John's Bedroom John is fairly nonchalant about you going into his room and using his stuff, though for the most part you don't take advantage of this. Like your room, John's room has a bed, dresser, desk, and an open closet door to the east.  Unlike your room, it is quite disorganized, to say the least.  Sheets are spread all over the room and clothes, as well as less-speakable debris, are strewn about, giving the room a ripe, musty odor not unlike rotting fruit in an ancient tomb; broken plastic models litter the scarred desk.  Set in the north wall is an open window to the outside world.  There is a (fortunately) open door to the south. You see a wastebasket here.  The wastebasket seems to contain a blue wrapper. You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by a plaintive, "Who pud this wall here *hic*." Evan follows you into John's bedroom. [ACTION] close window

[ACTION] close window [STATE] You slide the window shut, only to discover that there is a round, baseball-sized hole in the middle of the window which is admitting a large amount of wind into the room. The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment. "You know," says Evan philosophically, "in Taiwan, they have this phrase that describes desperate students who have to make a supreme last-minute effort to study for exams.  They're said to be 'kissing the Buddha's feet.'"  He looks pleased at having known that piece of trivia. [ACTION] examine wrapper

It's pastel blue, with a paisley pattern tastefully silkscreened on.  A small gold seal, mostly intact, has the logo for "Dee's Chocolates" on it. You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the rules for mah jongg. Evan gives a short speech about what's wrong with the nation's foreign policy and how he would change things.

[STATE] Looks like that won't fit in the hole. Evan talks about the impact of the longbow on the Hundred Years' War. [ACTION] examine desk [STATE] The decrepit state of John's desk bespeaks both a ripe old age as well as years of misuse; its surface bears many jagged scars and scorch marks.  Otherwise, the desk looks surprising clean (for a possession of John's), mainly because most of the junk that normally occupies its surface has been swept onto the floor or into the closet.  There is a single drawer on the desk, which is closed.  On the desk you see some broken plastic models; besides that, you see a handheld electronic trivia game. From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing "Send in the Clowns" along with the radio, and doing it badly.

There are also four buttons, colored red, yellow, green, and blue, lined up vertically to the left of the screen, next to where the possible answers to the game's questions will be displayed.  The game is currently off. The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from the direction of the living room.

There are no skeletons hiding here, but considering the amount of dust and dirty clothes around, you would hardly be surprised if one of the undead were lurking around in this dimly lit space.

[ACTION] west [STATE] Living Room This is the living room of your apartment.  Well, at least half of it *could* be called a living room, in the sense that a person could actually live in it.  You and John have long since decided that you would split the room into two, and each be responsible for each one's designated half.  Your half, which contains a tasteful paisley couch and mahogany table, looks bright and clean.  John's half, on the other hand, has piles of newspaper and beer cans, a ratty sofa which bleeds foam, and a study desk and chair, neither of which have seen much action until the last three days.  The center of the room contains items you have both consented to share, such as the TV set, which is currently off. The kitchen is to the west, the bedrooms and bath to the east, and the exit (through which you hope to see John go soon) to the north. You see a radio, three crumpled papers, a snack food bag, and a piece of cellophane here. John is here, sitting at his special studying desk, trying desperately to read his psychology textbook. Alice is here, looking a bit bored. Carl is here, entertaining himself in his usual banal manner. Distracted by all of the noise, John momentarily loses his concentration and starts muttering something about losing an electronic game on his desk. Evan follows you into the living room.

John, having a limited attention span at best, quickly abandoned this gift before he could get through its alleged "20,000 Questions!"  The case sports an LCD screen and a small speaker.  There are also four buttons, colored red, yellow, green, and blue, lined up vertically to the left of the screen, next to where the possible answers to the game's questions will be displayed.  The game is currently off. John wails to you, "Could you help quiz me?  Please?" "So, John," says Alice, "how're you doing hitting those books?  Real swell?"  John mumbles something uncomfortably and tries to continue studying. Evan wonders what the world would be like if it were love, not money, that made the world go round. [ACTION] put tape on speaker

Carl takes out a candy bar, strips the cellophane off of it, crumples it into a neat, compact ball, and tosses it absent-mindedly in the direction of the kitchen.  The cellophane bounces off the refrigerator, and skims the edge of the kitchen sink.  Just as it looks as if it would go in, it falls to the floor.
