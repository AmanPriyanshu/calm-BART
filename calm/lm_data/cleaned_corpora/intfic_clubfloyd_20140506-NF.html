As the notes cascade down in a soft blanket of Teutonic white, you hear a voice. "Mm-yes. Most satisfactory. I appear even to have brought your local precipitation along with your good self." As the papers slowly settle, you make out a figure in a long robe standing in front of you. As the figure leans forward to look at the lecture notes, you see a wizened and bespectacled old face with small beady features buried in a mass of white hair, beard and wrinkles. "However," he continues, picking up some of your lecture notes, "it seems a most unusual form of precipitation. No doubt localised to the university. I must give the idea some study one day." He drops the notes and extends a hand. "Welcome, my dear student. Please excuse the mess, but I'm sure you know the disorder a life of study - mm-yes - the work of the scholar - can bring. Oh, by the way, my name is Ninario, but my friends - erm, my acquaintances - call me Ninny." He pauses and frowns slightly. You shake his hand bemusedly, unsure what to make of your new surroundings. You are in a large rectangular room, with walls of grey stone. A huge set of double doors lie on the east wall. Opposite the doors are six windows, stretching from floor to ceiling. The sunlight streaming in through these reveals your lecture papers have added little to this fellow's mess - the floor is knee deep in loose papers, and books with dark leather covers are scattered at various points, like raisins buried in a mass of white bread. There are also several precarious-looking stacks of books standing up tall. Ninario picks up a book from the floor absently and looks around in some consternation, trying to find somewhere to put it. He settles for placing it on top of a large tower of books. The pile, already unsteady, takes unkindly to this latest affront, and collapses, separating into its component volumes and disappearing into the mass of white. Ninario expels a sigh of the long-suffering variety and returns his attention to you. "No doubt you are somewhat confused and disoriented by your journey. Perhaps, given the mess, it would be best if we retired to my study so I can explain why I've brought you here. Why don't you meet me there in a few minutes, just after I... erm, well, yes, attend to some other business. It's through the small oaken door across the hall."

Atop the West Wall The landscape of this strange place stretches out from the caer west to the horizon. Cultivated fields are spread out below, a multicoloured cloak draped over the shoulders of the land. A dry ribbon of road runs past the caer heading northeast and southwest through the fields. Villages, visible as small clusters of buildings, dot the farmlands. The fields continue flat and level for quite some distance, gradually leading into more hilly country. Beyond the hills, far in the distance, the many spires and towers of a city or large fortress rise up to touch the sky. The caer wall stretches away to the north and south.

There is a short stone bench jutting out from the wall, with a familiar round hole roughly in the middle of it. The Guild seem to have temporarily given over their main toilet for incarcerating Ninario. However magical the Guild are, it doesn't extend to their bodily functions; the smell in here is definitely not what you would call magical. Ninario glances at the small opening to the toilet distastefully. "After you, I'm sure, my dear student. Mm-yes." Suddenly, abruptly, the vision fades, and you are back where you started. The last of the Wensleydale vanishes from the bowl with a curious sucking sound and the bowl goes dim. [ACTION] north

Market Square A bustle of people and activity fills this cobblestoned market square. The people of Vechlee hurry about their business, intent on their daily tasks with barely a glance to spare for a lowly wizard's apprentice, otherworldly or not. Many different shops and establishments line the edges of the square. To the north is a sturdy workmanlike building, falling into disrepair. Large letters over the entrance read Vechlee Townspeople Building Society. To the south is a sprawling commercial edifice, with a seemingly endless stream of wizards pushing their way through the doors. Gilt-edged lettering over the door reads Wizards Guild Savings & Loan. To the northwest is a small shop, notable more for the lack of customers streaming into it than any other distinguishing characteristic. Small hand-lettered writing over the doorway reads Sorcery Supply. Southwest, the cobblestoned road heads out of the square and toward the western outskirts of Vechlee.

The bowl hums as it slowly consumes the raw curds to fuel its visionary powers. The bowl begins to glow with an otherworldly light and you gaze into its glowing silvery depths. Slowly, a scene forms in the depths of the bowl. You bend closer and suddenly feel yourself being pulled into the bowl. Tower Soaring high over the city below, the tower has a low parapet running all the way around it. Far below, you can see the bustle of people moving through the market square, a small undulating wave of humanity. The sunshine seems even stronger here, and the sky is a brilliant blue. A square opening in the middle of the rough stone floor leads back down into the tower. From somewhere within the building, you hear a bell ringing loudly, and the tramping of feet marching in step. Ninario is here, glancing around nervously. "This might be the perfect place to launch that carpet from," muses Ninario. You get on the threadbare red carpet. The edges flutter weakly and then the carpet seems to give up. "It doesn't seem to work," says Ninario. "That's not good. Mm-yes.

The shop is devoid of both staff and customers. It looks like it would have been a nice cozy little shop though, friendly and family-run, the kind of place where the staff remember your favourite cheeses, but can also sense when you're looking for something a little more adventurous, a little venture beyond your usual territory. The air is still scented with the aroma of many different cheeses mingled together. The open door to the north leads back to the street. Eliza hums to herself as she puts the finishing touches on a wheel of Camembert. Suddenly, the door bursts open and soldiers wearing the golden wand insignia of the Wizards Guild charge into the shop. The lead one steps forward. "Eliza Stilton, I hereby apprehend you on the charge of using scientific methods of preservation in the production of your cheeses. As decreed by the Wizards Guild, such practices are duly deemed a seditious and destabilising influence on the world of magic. Now, come along with us to the Guild Hall for processing, if you please." "No, you can't!" protests Eliza futilely. "All I did was keep the cheese in a cool room so it lasted longer, you can't arrest me for that, you can't!" Ignoring the cheesewright's pleas, the soldiers grab her and frogmarch her out the door, leaving the shop empty and abandoned.

North Vechlee The sprawling professional district of North Vechlee is home to many artists, craftspeople, tradesfolk and their families. Their shops and houses fill the small cluttered streets. An oddly silent shop lies to the west. It seems to have fallen upon hard economic times and is utterly abandoned, lacking even the dignity of boards over the windows.
