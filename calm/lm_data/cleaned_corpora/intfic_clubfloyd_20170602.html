Release 69 / Serial Number 850920 Hilltop You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron. To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands invitingly open. Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost nearby. Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you. Okay, what do you want to do now? Post Office This is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined with small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs along the entire length of the room. Your boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other people's postcards. Mr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. "Where have you been?" he barks angrily. "Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking everywhere for you!" (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 1 out of 100.) What next? (This story doesn't know the word "milboxes.") What next?

Your total score is 6 out of 100.) Mr. Crisp drums his fingers on the service counter impatiently. "Don't just stand there, idiot! The Magick Shoppe closes at five o'clock!" What next? As you leave the Post Office, somebody slams and locks the door behind you. Hilltop What next? Outside Cemetery You're standing next to an open iron gate that leads west into the Festeron Cemetery. A road runs east to the top of Post Office Hill. What next? The cemetery is a creepy place. Are you sure you want to go in there? (Please type YES or NO.) > You have been warned. Creepy Corner You're in a creepy corner of the Festeron Cemetery, surrounded by silent tombstones. An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane wanders north. What next? Spooky Copse A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west. There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected next to it. An old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree. The gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach. What next? The gravedigger reaches into the open grave and pulls you out. "Don't go in there!" he cries. "You might get buried alive!" The gravedigger notices the mysterious envelope you're holding. "That's a mighty mysterious-lookin' envelope you got there," he says. "Let's have a look at it." What next? The gravedigger peers at the address on the mysterious envelope. "Hmm," he mutters, handing it back to you. "Could've sworn I buried that old woman years ago." (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.) "Couldn't ask for a nicer day for diggin' graves." What next? It's six feet deep and freshly dug. You can see an old bone inside. "Got to go," says the gravedigger, picking up his shovel. "See you soon." The old man ambles away to the west. (You won't see the "What next?" prompt any more.) Open Grave You're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six-foot walls of dirt. There's an old bone here. Taken.

As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street, yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth. You can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps. The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 10 out of 100.) The poodle won't let you near the cottage. The poodle yaps a threat as you back away. Rotary South This is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south, towards Post Office Hill. The Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner. Miss Voss, the town librarian, is locking the library door as you approach. "Just the person I was looking for!" she exclaims, smiling brightly. She's holding a purse and an armful of books. Miss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her purse. "Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp," she coos, holding the note out to you. "I'd be ever so much obliged." Taken. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 13 out of 100.) Miss Voss hurries away down the street. "Thanks! Toody-loo!"

A street branches off to the east, towards the bay. On the corner nearby stands a charming little movie theater. Showtimes and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the closed entrance, and a marquee announces the current feature. (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!) It looks like the perfect place to enjoy an old movie. The marquee shows an outline of your mean old boss, Mr. Crisp, triumphantly stepping on the face of a helpless mail clerk. Underneath are the words "Have You Delivered That Envelope Yet?" in big red letters. The movie theater is closed. Park You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Festeron Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain, filled with sparkling water. A statue stands in the middle of the fountain. You can see a gold coin and a goldfish in the fountain. Taken. (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 14 out of 100.) The gold coin is etched with a profile of one of Festeron's founding fathers. You'd get soaked if you tried that!

Pleasure Wharf You're standing near the entrance to the Pleasure Wharf, the town's most popular tourist attraction. The Wharf extends eastward into Festeron Bay, and a tidal beach curves north along the shore. To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance. A big mailbox is nearby. (You don't need to use the word "shack" to finish this story.) Video Arcade This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op video games. The machines are all deserted and quiet, except for one in the corner that emits a feeble "wokka-wokka" sound. A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token." The game machine is equipped with a video screen, a joystick, a big red button and a narrow slot for tokens. A lurid logo ("LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS!") is painted on the side.

The lid of the big mailbox squeaks and snaps shut with a clang. But the big mailbox isn't open! Okay, the big mailbox is now open. Done. The lid of the big mailbox squeaks and snaps shut with a clang. Wharf's End The sea-worn planks of the Festeron Pleasure Wharf end abruptly a few feet to the east. You're surrounded by the blue, sparkling waters of Festeron Bay. Apparently a careless fisherman has just left the wharf, for lying on the planks is a little seahorse, its gills moving in and out with its dying gasps. The seahorse looks at you with moist, frightened eyes. Poor thing. It's at the edge of death. The seahorse opens and closes its little mouth pathetically. Taken. The seahorse's gills are barely moving. It's practically dead. Splash! The seahorse floats without moving for a few anxious moments. Then it springs suddenly to life, circling and splashing joyfully in the waves. Before it swims away it looks up at you with an unmistakable expression of gratitude.

The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you. A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick Shoppe." The Magick Shoppe door is closed. (You don't need to use the word "figure" to finish this story.)

Magick Shoppe You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe. Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards. In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a grinning crescent moon and other celestial symbols. The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain. A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily. "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain. As you approach the curtained exit, the Magick Shoppe subtly rearranges itself until you find yourself facing the other way. The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy. Time passes. The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump. The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen. You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late in the day." The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden. (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 19 out of 100.) The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you. "It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting," she murmurs, turning it over in her hands. "Hoped I never would again." She starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and hands it back to you. "Will you open it up and read it to me?" she pleads. "I'll never find my glasses in this mess." (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.) (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer package.) Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter. "Go ahead, dear. Don't be bashful. Read the letter to me, please. I'm waiting." (to the old woman) (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 20 out of 100.) The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet. "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly around the room, deep in thought. "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now," her voice breaking with emotion, "now it claims my only companion." Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and crumples them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard Wishbringer alone." "That's a long story," sighs the old woman wistfully. The old woman makes an effort to compose herself. "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take this little trinket anyway." The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take. Taken. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 23 out of 100.) "It's getting Dark outside," the old woman remarks, and you can almost hear the capital D. "Maybe you should be getting back to town." The Magick Shoppe door is closed. The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A concealed bell tinkles merrily. "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right HERE." The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun. [ACTION] examine

Release 69 / Serial Number 850920 Hilltop You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron. To the south stands the Festeron Post Office. It's a little brick building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands invitingly open. Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost nearby. Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you. Okay, what do you want to do now? Post Office This is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined with small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs along the entire length of the room. Your boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other people's postcards. Mr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. "Where have you been?" he barks angrily. "Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking everywhere for you!" (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 1 out of 100.) What next? (This story doesn't know the word "milboxes.") What next? The little mailboxes are closed and locked. Mr. Crisp reaches under the service counter and pulls out a mysterious envelope. "We just got this Special Delivery," he snarls, tossing it onto the service counter. "I want you to drop it off right away. That means NOW!" What next? Taken. (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 6 out of 100.) Mr. Crisp drums his fingers on the service counter impatiently. "Don't just stand there, idiot! The Magick Shoppe closes at five o'clock!" What next? As you leave the Post Office, somebody slams and locks the door behind you. Hilltop What next? Outside Cemetery You're standing next to an open iron gate that leads west into the Festeron Cemetery. A road runs east to the top of Post Office Hill. What next? The cemetery is a creepy place. Are you sure you want to go in there? (Please type YES or NO.) > You have been warned. Creepy Corner You're in a creepy corner of the Festeron Cemetery, surrounded by silent tombstones. An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane wanders north. What next? Spooky Copse A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west. There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected next to it. An old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree. The gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach. What next? The gravedigger reaches into the open grave and pulls you out. "Don't go in there!" he cries. "You might get buried alive!" The gravedigger notices the mysterious envelope you're holding. "That's a mighty mysterious-lookin' envelope you got there," he says. "Let's have a look at it." What next? The gravedigger peers at the address on the mysterious envelope. "Hmm," he mutters, handing it back to you. "Could've sworn I buried that old woman years ago." (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.) "Couldn't ask for a nicer day for diggin' graves." What next? It's six feet deep and freshly dug. You can see an old bone inside. "Got to go," says the gravedigger, picking up his shovel. "See you soon." The old man ambles away to the west. (You won't see the "What next?" prompt any more.) Open Grave You're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six-foot walls of dirt. There's an old bone here. Taken. (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 7 out of 100.) With great difficulty, you manage to climb out of the open grave. Spooky Copse Creepy Corner The tombstones block your path. Whew! That cemetery sure is spooky. Outside Cemetery You can't go that way. Hilltop You'd fall down the hill if you went that way. Outside Cottage You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the town librarian. The road turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post Office Hill. As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street, yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth. You can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps. The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 10 out of 100.) The poodle won't let you near the cottage. The poodle yaps a threat as you back away. Rotary South This is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south, towards Post Office Hill. The Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner. Miss Voss, the town librarian, is locking the library door as you approach. "Just the person I was looking for!" she exclaims, smiling brightly. She's holding a purse and an armful of books. Miss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her purse. "Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp," she coos, holding the note out to you. "I'd be ever so much obliged." Taken. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 13 out of 100.) Miss Voss hurries away down the street. "Thanks! Toody-loo!"

A street branches off to the east, towards the bay. On the corner nearby stands a charming little movie theater. Showtimes and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the closed entrance, and a marquee announces the current feature. (There aren't any verbs in that sentence!) It looks like the perfect place to enjoy an old movie. The marquee shows an outline of your mean old boss, Mr. Crisp, triumphantly stepping on the face of a helpless mail clerk. Underneath are the words "Have You Delivered That Envelope Yet?" in big red letters. The movie theater is closed. Park You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Festeron Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain, filled with sparkling water. A statue stands in the middle of the fountain. You can see a gold coin and a goldfish in the fountain. Taken. (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 14 out of 100.) The gold coin is etched with a profile of one of Festeron's founding fathers. You'd get soaked if you tried that!

Pleasure Wharf You're standing near the entrance to the Pleasure Wharf, the town's most popular tourist attraction. The Wharf extends eastward into Festeron Bay, and a tidal beach curves north along the shore. To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance. A big mailbox is nearby. (You don't need to use the word "shack" to finish this story.) Video Arcade This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin-op video games. The machines are all deserted and quiet, except for one in the corner that emits a feeble "wokka-wokka" sound. A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token." The game machine is equipped with a video screen, a joystick, a big red button and a narrow slot for tokens. A lurid logo ("LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS!") is painted on the side.

You'd have to open the big mailbox to do that. Okay, the big mailbox is now open. You can see nothing interesting inside the big mailbox. The lid of the big mailbox squeaks and snaps shut with a clang. But the big mailbox isn't open! Okay, the big mailbox is now open. Done. The lid of the big mailbox squeaks and snaps shut with a clang. Wharf's End The sea-worn planks of the Festeron Pleasure Wharf end abruptly a few feet to the east. You're surrounded by the blue, sparkling waters of Festeron Bay. Apparently a careless fisherman has just left the wharf, for lying on the planks is a little seahorse, its gills moving in and out with its dying gasps. The seahorse looks at you with moist, frightened eyes. Poor thing. It's at the edge of death. The seahorse opens and closes its little mouth pathetically. Taken. The seahorse's gills are barely moving. It's practically dead. Splash! The seahorse floats without moving for a few anxious moments. Then it springs suddenly to life, circling and splashing joyfully in the waves. Before it swims away it looks up at you with an unmistakable expression of gratitude.

The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you. A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick Shoppe." The Magick Shoppe door is closed. (You don't need to use the word "figure" to finish this story.) Cliff Edge You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. The Magick Shoppe stands nearby. A voice cries, "Come in!" (It's 4:00 pm. Better hurry! The Magick Shoppe closes in less than an hour!) The Magick Shoppe door is closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily. Okay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open. Magick Shoppe You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe. Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards. In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a grinning crescent moon and other celestial symbols. The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain. A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily. "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain. As you approach the curtained exit, the Magick Shoppe subtly rearranges itself until you find yourself facing the other way. The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy. Time passes. The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump. The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen. You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late in the day." The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden. (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 19 out of 100.) The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you. "It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting," she murmurs, turning it over in her hands. "Hoped I never would again." She starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and hands it back to you. "Will you open it up and read it to me?" she pleads. "I'll never find my glasses in this mess." (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.) (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer package.) Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter. "Go ahead, dear. Don't be bashful. Read the letter to me, please. I'm waiting." (to the old woman) (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 20 out of 100.) The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet. "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly around the room, deep in thought. "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now," her voice breaking with emotion, "now it claims my only companion." Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and crumples them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard Wishbringer alone." "That's a long story," sighs the old woman wistfully. The old woman makes an effort to compose herself. "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take this little trinket anyway." The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take. Taken. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 23 out of 100.) "It's getting Dark outside," the old woman remarks, and you can almost hear the capital D. "Maybe you should be getting back to town." The Magick Shoppe door is closed. The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A concealed bell tinkles merrily. "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right HERE." The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun. [ACTION] examine [STATE]  [ACTION] examine ask fun logic puzzle

The walls are lined with small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs along the entire length of the room. Your boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other people's postcards. Mr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. "Where have you been?" he barks angrily. "Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking everywhere for you!" (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 1 out of 100.) What next? The little mailboxes are closed and locked. Mr. Crisp reaches under the service counter and pulls out a mysterious envelope. "We just got this Special Delivery," he snarls, tossing it onto the service counter. "I want you to drop it off right away. That means NOW!" What next? Taken. (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 6 out of 100.) Mr. Crisp drums his fingers on the service counter impatiently. "Deliver that envelope! The Magick Shoppe closes at five o'clock!" What next?

A road runs east to the top of Post Office Hill. What next? The cemetery is a fearful place. Are you sure you want to go in there? (Please type YES or NO.) > You have been warned. Creepy Corner You're in a creepy corner of the Festeron Cemetery, surrounded by silent tombstones. An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane wanders north. What next? Spooky Copse A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west. There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected next to it. An old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree. The gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach. What next? He's the town gravedigger, a village fixture since before you were born. The gravedigger notices the mysterious envelope you're holding. "That's a mighty mysterious-lookin' envelope you got there," he says. "Let's have a look at it." What next? The gravedigger peers at the address on the mysterious envelope. "Hmm," he mutters, handing it back to you. "Could've sworn I buried that old woman years ago." (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.) "Couldn't ask for a nicer day for diggin' graves." What next? It's six feet deep and freshly dug. You can see an old bone inside. "Got to go," says the gravedigger, picking up his shovel. "See you soon." The old man ambles away to the west. (You won't see the "What next?" prompt any more.) Open Grave You're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six-foot walls of dirt. There's an old bone here. Taken. (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 7 out of 100.) With great difficulty, you manage to climb out of the open grave. Spooky Copse Twilight Glen The trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the tombstones winds off to the east. There must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their umbrella leaning up against a tombstone. The gravedigger is locking the iron gate from the outside as you approach. "Keep out of the cemetery after Dark," he tells you with a sly wink. You can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north. Taken. Spooky Copse Creepy Corner Whew! That cemetery sure is spooky. Outside Cemetery Hilltop Outside Cottage You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the town librarian. The road turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post Office Hill. As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street, yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth. You can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps. The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 10 out of 100.) The poodle yaps a threat as you back away. Rotary South This is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south, towards Post Office Hill. The Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner. Miss Voss, the town librarian, is locking the library door as you approach. "Just the person I was looking for!" she exclaims, smiling brightly. She's holding a purse and an armful of books. Miss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her purse. "Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp," she coos, holding the note out to you. "I'd be ever so much obliged." Taken. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 13 out of 100.) Miss Voss hurries away down the street. "Thanks! Toody-loo!" Park You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Festeron Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain, filled with sparkling water. A statue stands in the middle of the fountain. Taken. (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 14 out of 100.) Rotary North This is the northern side of the Festeron Rotary. A road leads north, towards the river. On the corner stands a quaint village church. Its little white steeple is straight out of a country postcard. The church door stands invitingly open. South of Bridge This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to the village. Rocky Path You're on a rocky path that runs east and west along the banks of the Festeron River. A dense, impenetrable forest borders the south edge of the path. Lighthouse This is where the river empties into Festeron Bay. A beach follows the shore of the bay to the south, and a path leads west along the riverbank. A miniature lighthouse, barely ten feet high, stands blinking on the shore nearby. Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through half-closed eyelids. Tidal Pool You're on a damp stretch of sand that extends north towards Festeron Point, and south to the Pleasure Wharf. A large conch shell is lying in the sand at your feet. Taken. Pleasure Wharf You're standing near the entrance to the Pleasure Wharf, the town's most popular tourist attraction. The Wharf extends eastward into Festeron Bay, and a tidal beach curves north along the shore. To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance. A big mailbox is nearby. Wharf's End The sea-worn planks of the Festeron Pleasure Wharf end abruptly a few feet to the east. You're surrounded by the blue, sparkling waters of Festeron Bay. Apparently a careless fisherman has just left the wharf, for lying on the planks is a little seahorse, its gills moving in and out with its dying gasps. The seahorse looks at you with moist, frightened eyes. Taken. The seahorse opens and closes its little mouth pathetically. Splash! The seahorse floats without moving for a few anxious moments. Then it springs suddenly to life, circling and splashing joyfully in the waves. Before it swims away it looks up at you with an unmistakable expression of gratitude. Pleasure Wharf A big mailbox is nearby. Rotary East You're on the eastern side of the Festeron Rotary. A street branches off to the east, towards the bay. On the corner nearby stands a charming little movie theater. Showtimes and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the closed entrance, and a marquee announces the current feature. Rotary North South of Bridge Bridge You're on a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead. North of Bridge This is the north side of the Festeron Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river. Cliff Bottom You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river. A steep trail winds upward. A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. (The trail you're climbing is narrow and twisty. It's a good idea to draw a map as you go up.) Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds west and downward. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds north and east. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds south and upward. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds east and downward. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds south and west. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds north and upward. (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 15 out of 100.) Cliff Edge You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of clouds. The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you. A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick Shoppe." A concealed bell tinkles merrily. Okay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open. Magick Shoppe You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe. Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards. In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a sneering crescent moon and other celestial symbols. The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain. A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily. "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain. The smiling grandfather clock says it's 3:52 pm. The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy. You can see nothing interesting inside the grandfather clock. The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump. The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen. You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late in the day." The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden. (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of 100.) The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you.

(You are again holding the mysterious envelope.) (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer package.) Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter. "Don't be bashful. Read the letter to me, please." (to the old woman) (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of 100.) The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet. "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly around the room, deep in thought. "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to conceal it from the Evil One and others like her.

Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and crumples them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard Wishbringer alone." Strange. Despite your best efforts, the front door refuses to budge. "That door always sticks this time of year," notes the old woman drily. The old woman makes an effort to compose herself. "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take this little trinket anyway." The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take. Taken. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 24 out of 100.) "It's getting Dark outside," the old woman remarks, and you can almost hear the capital D. "Maybe you should be getting back to town." The Magick Shoppe door is closed. The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A concealed bell tinkles merrily. "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right HERE." The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun. Your body seems unwilling to respond. The old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling. "The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely on legends to instruct you in its mysteries." As she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door. "Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours. "Her name is Chaos." A concealed bell tinkles merrily. Cliff Edge You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. The surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist... ... an island with a tower on it. There's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare, the clearer and more frightening it becomes. The Magick Shoppe stands nearby. As you descend the trail you are immediately engulfed in... Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. A sudden gust of wind dissolves the fog and clears your vision. Cliff Bottom You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river. A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. A vulture perched on top is watching every move you make. The vulture spreads its wings and soars away over your head. North of Bridge This is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river. A rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the closed gate. Standing near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less original story would probably refer to it as a troll. Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and slithers out of sight. The metal can clatters to the ground. A scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across the covered bridge. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 27 out of 100.) Taken. Okay, the toll gate is now open. Bridge You're on a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead. South of Bridge This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to the village. [ACTION] inventory

Then it springs suddenly to life, circling and splashing joyfully in the waves. Before it swims away it looks up at you with an unmistakable expression of gratitude. Pleasure Wharf A big mailbox is nearby. Rotary East You're on the eastern side of the Festeron Rotary. A street branches off to the east, towards the bay. On the corner nearby stands a charming little movie theater. Showtimes and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the closed entrance, and a marquee announces the current feature. Rotary North South of Bridge Bridge You're on a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead. North of Bridge This is the north side of the Festeron Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river. Cliff Bottom You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river. A steep trail winds upward. A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. (The trail you're climbing is narrow and twisty. It's a good idea to draw a map as you go up.) Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds west and downward. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds north and east. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds south and upward. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds east and downward. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds south and west. Steep Trail A steep, rocky trail winds north and upward. (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 15 out of 100.) Cliff Edge You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of clouds. The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you. A little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick Shoppe." A concealed bell tinkles merrily. Okay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open. Magick Shoppe You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe. Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards. In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a sneering crescent moon and other celestial symbols. The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain. A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily. "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain. The smiling grandfather clock says it's 3:52 pm. The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy. You can see nothing interesting inside the grandfather clock. The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump. The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen. You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late in the day." The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden. (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of 100.) The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you. "It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting," she murmurs, turning it over in her hands. "Hoped I never would again." She starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and hands it back to you. "Will you open it up and read it to me?" she pleads. "I'll never find my glasses in this mess." (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.) (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer package.) Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter. "Don't be bashful. Read the letter to me, please." (to the old woman) (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of 100.) The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet. "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly around the room, deep in thought. "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now," her voice breaking with emotion, "now it claims my only companion." Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and crumples them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard Wishbringer alone." Strange. Despite your best efforts, the front door refuses to budge. "That door always sticks this time of year," notes the old woman drily. The old woman makes an effort to compose herself. "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take this little trinket anyway." The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take. Taken. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 24 out of 100.) "It's getting Dark outside," the old woman remarks, and you can almost hear the capital D. "Maybe you should be getting back to town." The Magick Shoppe door is closed. The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A concealed bell tinkles merrily. "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right HERE." The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun. Your body seems unwilling to respond. The old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling. "The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely on legends to instruct you in its mysteries." As she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door. "Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours. "Her name is Chaos." A concealed bell tinkles merrily. Cliff Edge You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. The surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist... ... an island with a tower on it. There's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare, the clearer and more frightening it becomes. The Magick Shoppe stands nearby. As you descend the trail you are immediately engulfed in... Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. Fog You're lost in a thick cloud of fog. A sudden gust of wind dissolves the fog and clears your vision. Cliff Bottom You're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river. A gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. A vulture perched on top is watching every move you make. The vulture spreads its wings and soars away over your head. North of Bridge This is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river. A rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the closed gate. Standing near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less original story would probably refer to it as a troll. Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and slithers out of sight. The metal can clatters to the ground. A scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across the covered bridge. (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 27 out of 100.) Taken. Okay, the toll gate is now open. Bridge You're on a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead. South of Bridge This is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to the village.

You can feel little icky things sliding down your throat. The hellhound glares at you through eyes red with hatred. The night becomes very still as you speak the Wish. The hellhound stops in mid-roar, cocks its head and sniffs the air nervously. All at once a terrifying shadow sweeps across the face of the full moon, plunging the landscape into total darkness. The hellhound's eyes grow wide with terror. It flops itself down on the ground, covers its eyes with its forepaws and moans pitifully in the sudden gloom. (Thankfully, the icky taste of grue milk is gone.) The hellhound howls mournfully in the darkness as you creep past. It is pitch black. As suddenly as it faded, the light of the moon returns. Rotary South This is the south side of the Witchville Rotary. A road branches south, towards Post Office Hill. The Witchville Public Library, once famous for its museum of local historic artifacts, stands in a pitiful state of disrepair. The vulture appears high overhead. You can't unlock a library!

Come over around sixish, and I'll show you my collection of Byron first editions, etc... Violet PS: If my little poodle yaps at you, just say ALEXIS, HEEL and she'll behave." The night is filled with rhythmic thunder, and a platoon of gigantic leather army boots marches into view. It's the Boot Patrol again! You're immediately surrounded, tied, gagged and dragged before an especially tall Boot. "What!" he cries. "I thought you were locked up with Sgt. MacGuffin. Tsk, tsk." You're thrown into an especially smelly Boot and carried, kicking and screaming, to the lobby of the Police Station. Sgt. MacGuffin glares at you as the boots dump you on the floor. His eyes narrow when he sees you. "Well, well. If it isn't the disappearing mail clerk." You open your mouth to reply, but a vicious little kick changes your mind. "The Tower wants a chat with this troublemaker." "The sharks are getting restless," remarks the Tall Boot hopefully. Sgt. MacGuffin smirks. "So is the Evil One." Jail Cell You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel door and stone walls offer little hope for escape. The only furnishing is a hard bunk against the wall.

Laboratory The highest room in the tower is a laboratory, complete with bubbling chemicals and foul odors. An antique telescope is mounted near an open window to the north, and a control panel occupies most of the south wall. The only exit is a damp stairway leading downward. A black cat is sound asleep in the corner. There's a broom here. (Sorry, but the word "pannel" is not in the vocabulary that you can use.) The control panel is equipped with two large power switches. Which switches do you mean, the first switch or the second switch? The first switch is labeled, "Palace Theater," and is turned on. (Presumably, you mean the second switch.)

Hilltop The moment you take your foot off the drawbridge it swings up over the moat and closes with a mighty thud. Outside Cottage You're outside the cottage of Miss Voss, the former town librarian. The road turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post Office Hill. As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the biggest hellhound you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street, roaring angrily and showing its sharp, bloody fangs. You can smell the hellhound's hot breath as it roars. Alexis pricks up her ears at the sound of her name. She sits obediently at your feet, gently licks your hand and thumps her big tail happily. (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 89 out of 100.) The hellhound is thumping its big tail happily. [ACTION] inventory
