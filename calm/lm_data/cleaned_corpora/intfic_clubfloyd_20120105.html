Its tires and radio are completely destroyed, leaving you stranded in this beautiful but empty ruin and completely unable to contact your coworkers in the Prometheus Corp shuttle floating overhead. You look up at the shuttle, plainly visible in the earthlight but too far away to stand any chance of seeing you. You turn back toward the retreating form of the rover, barely visible now. Assured now that you will be stranded here for hours before the shuttle begins to worry about your safety, Titan will report exclusive discovery of this ruin, leaving you and your company in the dust. Immediately your mind begins to race, seeking a way to signal the shuttle. If only that spotlight overhead were pointed upward! If only it were turned on....

There is no pressure dome, leaving the dusty streets exposed to near-vacuum, but the buildings have the tall, rectangular shapes familiar to you from the Tokyo skyline.

There is no pressure dome, leaving the dusty streets exposed to near-vacuum, but the buildings have the tall, rectangular shapes familiar to you from the Tokyo skyline.

It is the hottest summer of all time (or at least it feels that way now that your electricity has been cut off). Your lack of employment has finally caught up with you. Your funds have been depleted and your pockets are empty. Last month's essentials (cable television and Internet access) are now but sweet memories. The lack of air conditioning feels like the final straw. You were really hoping to starve to death at a comfortable 68 degrees. Yesterday for lunch you boiled and ate two hot dog wieners. For dinner, you drank the water you boiled them in. (Mmm, "Hot Dog Soup".) So far your dignity has kept you from rummaging through trash cans for food, but it's starting to sound like a viable option. Just the thought of sinking your teeth into someone else's left over pizza crust makes your mouth water. The current economy has made it hell for a spoiled, out-of-work computer programmer such as yourself to find work.  It wasn't too long ago that a five-figure salary seemed beneath you; today, given your current state of affairs, you would accept four. It's time to find a job and find some food, and find them today.
