Thus you urge your good friend to consider climbing down from your hands as soon as possible, as your fingers which you've hooked together to make her a foothold are beginning to ache. You're standing on a narrow ledge on top of a a brick wall, which is overshadowed by the higher stone wall of the Royal Nest. Your quickly-assembled plan to peek into the hangar has gone well so far. You found the proper spot just in time... [Picture number 3 here.] Not long ago, couriers brought news of a team of ambassadors being sent from the distant land of Ashtarta, in order to extend relationships with your fortified hometown of Arg Varkana. That sounded like good news; Ashtartans are advancing in many fields (and in territory, you pondered cautiously) and so maybe your secluded mountainous city-state, which is known only for its wine and pistachios, could benefit from good relations with them. Everything would have been going normally if it wasn't for a conversation with Behzaad, your bookcrafting mentor. Last night at the dining hall he sat by you and gave you a task; your final task of apprenticeship, as he oddly called it: to repair an old book of poetry which is currently being held in the museum. Before leaving the table, Behzaad gravely added that you'd better hide the book from the Ember order of Ashtartan scholars. They would want it at any price, especially in its current damaged state. Enjoying your summer repose, you didn't give priority to his request, despite having heard ominous rumors of the diligent scholars and their disdain for law... until this evening, when to your amazement you heard news of Behzaad's departure from the town. However, before you could make up your mind what to do, the ambassadors' forthcoming arrival was announced. A party of your town's officials prepared to go and greet them in the Royal Nest where their vehicles had landed. You finally decided to get the book at once, but by then it was too late; the museum building was already closed. Your friend Nivanen suggested that you check to see whether or not there were any Ember scholars among the guests in the first place, as it is said that they are recognizable by the grey and red medallions they proudly wear around their necks. So the two of you set out to find a good vantage point from which to survey the guests before they go through the welcoming procedure and are guided to their lodging for the night...

"You must receive plenty of comissions." His brief compliment doesn't totally cheer you, but you recover your modesty, "Oh... not often these days.

"Yes, recently he told me to repair an old poem book from the museum's collection just before he left town, which I haven't done yet. Uh... what?" The tingling goes as quickly as it came. You wonder if it was your imagination. A smile crosses his lips, "From what I hear, the last task he requests from his pupils is usually an extraordinary one. I wonder what's in that old poem book he asked you to repair. Something exciting, no doubt." He carefully closes the big book before him. "I must go and join the other ambassadors now. I wish I could stay here longer, or visit the old temple over there to do a drawing of Senmervae. But my time is short..." He gets up and starts tidying the books on a table. "Perhaps I can do it? The drawing, I mean," you ask hesitantly. "Ah, actually I'd really appreciate that. If you have time, of course." "I do, besides, it's a pleasant thing to draw. See you at lunch, I guess."

[STATE] From this trapdoor you managed to get inside the Nest without being noticed last night. [ACTION] down [STATE] You descend into a network of tunnels. Ardavaan draws a glow orb from his robes and you lead him in the approximate direction of the Royal Nest's vehicle hangar. Behind a locked door you hold the glow orb for Ardavaan so that he can handle his lockpick. From his trembling hands and sweated brow you can tell maintaining constant control on Farahnaaz is wearing him out... A few times she stumbles in her trance, but Ardavaan reaches for her on time. For your part, your cat tends to go astray in the labyrinth and is deaf to your commands. Ardavaan catches Rasha before he finally pushes the last door open. You gasp in amazement; you're right behind the large Ashtartan vessel you saw last night and it looks even more gorgeous from up close. Disgruntled, Rasha knocks the glow orb off Ardavaan's hand. It drops and shatters into tiny splinters. Hangar (Royal Nest) The hangar is a spacious chamber with a high ceiling. Unlike the noisy halls where flying beasts perch, this place is clean of hay and doesn't smell. An access door for the passengers and the staff lies to the north. A pair of sliding gates lead to the landing platform to the west and are currently closed. The entrance to the tunnels is to the east. There's a large Ashtartan vessel in middle of chamber, with two identical one-man vehicles by its sides. Ardavaan walks around the large vessel while inspecting it. He then goes to a one-man vehicle, but shakes his head, "It's too dark here without the glow orb." He calls on you to help him open the sliding gates so that more light can enter the hangar.

Ardavaan growls in pain and beckons to Farahnaaz, who lunges towards you. You try to kick her back without harming her seriously, but your legs suddenly get numb and falter. As you fall, Ardavaan pulls Farahnaaz and limps backwards, holding an odd handgun in his other hand.

Quickly, Nivanen, I need one of your weapons!" "No... I prefer we capture you alive than dead." The watchmen are momentarily surprised to find an ambassador and a town guard inside. They ask what you're doing here. Your gaze meets Ardavaan's and you take one step back in alarm, but too late. Frenzied for not having been given a weapon, he seizes your shoulder and forcefully hurls you to the nearest watchman. You go head first into his chest and you both fall. You see the legs of the second man go limp, and he drops to the ground near you, motionless. The third one gets savagely kicked in the ribs, but the last one leaps for Ardavaan and strives to prevent him from escaping into the vessel. The first watchman shoves you aside, gets up, and charges his crossbow. At the first opportunity he releases a metal bolt aimed at his target's neck. You come over to Ardavaan but he's already dead; the pool of his blood on the floor constantly expanding. Hung from the chain around his neck you can now see the unmistakable Ember medallion sticking out of his collar, depicting a red goknous bird rising from gray ashes. His hand holds a pistol of some sort. A watchman gently pushes you aside and covers his dead body. You yell at him for not having captured him instead. He replies that he was too dangerous and uncontrollable. The sadness in his voice turns your attention to the body of his colleague who's been paralyzed to death... by Ardavaan's gun. You go to the vessel and see Farahnaaz is still asleep. However, upon closer inspection you realize she isn't breathing. *** Your Adventure is over *** In that game you scored 78 out of a possible 90, in 749 turns. ? [ACTION] give axe to ardavaan

[ACTION] give axe to ardavaan [STATE] No way you're going to give your axe to Ardavaan again. You hand him your javelin instead. "Well I could do with a javelin." You obey the watchmen and hold your hands up. Ardavaan casts you a side glance and slowly does the same, however, you're now wiser than to take it for surrender. A prickling flows up your arms and you realize you're unable to move them. You're then engulfed with a sensation not unlike falling from a great height, and in your panic you no longer hear the questions they are asking. Ardavaan draws a deep breath. Then with a sudden jolt your arms and his are thrown forth. The men are all transfixed with an unseen power. With a powerful, commanding voice Ardavaan tells them to get out and immediately runs toward them. Dazed, they rush for the door without question. He then closes and bars the door by putting your javelin behind the slender columns which decorate the entrance; what, you regret, didn't cross your own mind before. As soon as he bars the door, you hear the men yelling and hitting the door in an attempt to break it open. Ardavaan runs back to the vessel and turns on the engine while you enter the seat next to the pilot. He then steers the vessel out of the hangar. Above the clouds (in vessel) In vessel you can see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Rasha. You sink into your seat, occasionally moving your arms and hands to make sure they're in your command. Ardavaan gives you a playful smile, "I briefly channeled your force without your permission." "Yes, you leeched something out of me. Are you happy with it?" "I'm just glad you didn't resist. But if I'm not mistaken, in Arg Varkana people don't know how to do it." "Do what?" His smile fades, "You don't block your minds to intrusions." "Well, we guardians learn some stuff about it and get some training, but since we have no use for it most tend to forget." "You've been fortunate, but it won't last long." "If there are more of your kind in Ashtarta... I hope our Argbaan knows about it." He nods. "Lady Atossa knows. And she did so even before I warned her." Your eyes widen in surprise. But he firmly changes the topic, "Now, let's see where we can stop to rest. There should be a map behind my seat. Please take it, I need you to find us a destination." Whatever his motives, Ardavaan managed to steal the poem book and has now escaped with his life. You trust his word on restoring Farahnaaz and sending you back home, and both of you keep to this temporary truce, but somewhere in the back of your mind you wish you could have discovered more about him and his mission. Perhaps you could have tried harder to gain his trust... You shrug; he may have escaped from Varkana, but he's still in your grasp - from your new point of view. Future adventures seem unavoidable. You try to brace yourself for whatever lies ahead. *** Congratulations! *** In that game you scored 78 out of a possible 90, in 749 turns. ? [ACTION] look

The entrance to the tunnels is to the east. There's a large Ashtartan vessel in middle of chamber, with two identical one-man vehicles by its sides. You can also see Ardavaan and Farahnaaz here. [ACTION] examine door [STATE] This door is the only other ground access to this chamber beside the tunnels. It stands between a pair of slender columns. [ACTION] bar door

[STATE] What do you want to bar the access door with? [ACTION] javelin [STATE] You bar the door by jamming your javelin behind the columns and in front of the door. Its length is only just adequate, and you hope it'll hold long enough. "I really appreciate that," Ardavaan says, a bit surprised. "... Despite how the things may appear to you, I'm not here to cause trouble. It's a very important matter... perhaps I could discuss it later."

Are you sure you're ready to open the gates? [ACTION] yes
[STATE] The huge sliding gates will be laborsome to open and might attract the people who work here. Are you sure you're ready to open the gates? [ACTION] yes [STATE] Together you push the gates open and allow daylight into the hangar. They are very noisy, it'll be a matter of time before those who heard it will show up. Ardavaan kneels by one of the one-man vehicles. He hastily opens a small shaft on the engine and snaps something inside which produces a few sparks. He then closes the shaft, absently licking two burnt fingertips. You remind him to awaken Farahnaaz before leaving. He doesn't reply. [Your score has just gone up by three points.] [ACTION] wait

"If you insist. But I don't promise anything." "You don't?" "I'd risk irreversible failure. I need rest." "But you can't rest, even if I stand watch..." "Don't pretend to be an imbecile, Nivanen. We'll fly away from here and I'll awaken her once I'm rested." "Ah, and you'll send us back on foot. You forgot where we are." He shrugs, "Or you'll come with me to somewhere I can arrange you a flight back. Now..." He motions for you to stand aside, and you obey - much to your surprise. He repeats the same procedure on the second small vehicle. You wince when his hand burns again. You hear muffled voices from behind the access door, and the sound of a key turning in the keyhole. [ACTION] wait

Ardavaan raises the hood of the large vessel and releases Rasha who jumps inside. Then he lifts Farahnaaz and places her in the back seat. Farahnaaz's eyes close and her head drops to her chest. The men try to push the door open but find it's jammed. They start hitting it ferociously. Ardavaan calls you to quickly enter the vessel as he gets into the pilot's seat and turns on the engine.
