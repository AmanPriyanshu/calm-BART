They had the same cabin, and they slept in the same bed, but chastely, rarely keeping even the same hours.  And Jerry accepted it, and his simple acceptance made her smile. He was in love with something else, of course - something darker and fiercer than she could ever be - and she felt sad for that, though relieved that it kept his attentions at bay. She thought about that as he laughed above his wineglass, all white teeth and sparkling eyes, and thought about it as she smiled back. She didn't want his love.  She wouldn't have minded if she could have it, if she could be capable of stealing it, but she didn't want it.  But could she break his other love?  That might make his life even better.

You turn your attention higher up the body, to the flappy cheeks and lips and nose and eyes.  You bite and tear and chew, savoring each delectable mouthful.  And you dream.... The fire started after she cut the phone lines, and the house burned to the ground.  Her sister's voice was higher-pitched than she had ever heard it - "My god, Roselle, what were you thinking? Whatever were you thinking?" She'd been thinking, it would be so easy to make sure your awful boss never calls you again on a weekend.  She'd been thinking, all it takes is scissors.  She'd been thinking, I have scissors. The cargo pants had giant pockets, and the scissors were still in her pocket.  If she slipped, they would go straight into her thigh. She didn't slip, or even move.  She stood quietly, instead, and listened to her sister, and watched the scorched rubble smoke softly. The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the currents. [ACTION] eat tall human
