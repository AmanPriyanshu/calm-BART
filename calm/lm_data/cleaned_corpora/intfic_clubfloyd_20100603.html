I was back in my old house, the one from before I moved to the machine, but it was empty, and the world was ruled by insectoid aliens, but I just accepted that as good, because they had mind-control powers or something. I escaped by riding a missile (another blatant phallic symbol), and wound up on the moon, in another of those strange laboratories which seem to be the most common feature of my dreams these days.
