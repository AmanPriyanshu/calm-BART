New possibilities emerge. The Verde may not have been one woman, but two, a partnership that turned sour. One of them planned to blow all the money on some junk real estate for the field mice. The other waited for the right opportunity to make a move against her. There's a sucker born every day, you guess. You pick up the little green heart and crush it between your fingers.
