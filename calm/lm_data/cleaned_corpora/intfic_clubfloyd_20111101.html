A mask! Should you be wearing a mask? The cashier will see your face! Or the bikers will see your face, and they'll know it was you! No, hold on.

[ACTION] look [STATE] Outside Paco's Tacos Here's the entrance to Paco's Tacos, everyone's favorite place for a bite as long as everything else is closed. The stretch of sidewalk here is covered by a striped awning for the masses to huddle under while waiting for a table at peak hours. The door to the north is framed by neon signs behind plate glass windows. Further east is Get Your Licks. Now is a good time to go over the plan before you pull the job. It'd be nice if you had everything written down as a reminder, but a note like that could end up being incriminating. So, mentally, as you're standing here in front of the taco shop, remember: Once you're inside, you're going to go north across the dining room, to where the counter is. Then you're going to point the gun at the cashier and, without hesitating, tell the cashier to open the cash register. When that's done, tell the cashier to take the money from the register and tell the cashier to give the money to you. (But don't say "to you", say "to me".) Finally, while still pointing the gun at the cashier, walk backward to the entrance. Once you're back outside, you just have to get to your car and drive away. Nobody will get hurt, nobody will recognize you, and best of all, nobody will get evicted. [ACTION] north

That thing you just bumped into, evidently a sweaty, balding man, snatches the envelope from your hands without so much as a thank you. "Make sure and lock up my office when you leave," he barks at the cashier. The cashier merely mumbles in response, but his boss is already stomping his way out.

Set into the wall behind the desk and looking extremely out of place in this atmosphere of squalor is an expensive-looking safe.
