Next he somehow reaches through the control panel and presses the reactor shield button and you see the faint shadow of the previous shield slide closed. Hopefully his version of the reactor is now safe. He then succumbs to radiation exposure and collapses. The temporal reactor finally goes critical and explodes again. Please press SPACE to continue.
