The concrete-floored room gives the impression of spaciousness simply because of how empty it is: an artist's easel sits right in the centre of the space, with an expensive-looking chair facing it. A floor-length window on the east wall adds to the discomforting sense of open space. The north wall, bare-bricked, looks strangely out of character with the painted walls of the rest of the house. The door is set into the west wall. Marissa, apparently deep in concentration, doesn't even glance up from her painting as I enter the room. [ACTION] ask marissa for key [STATE] I'm not sure what that refers to. [ACTION] talk to marissa
[STATE] I'm not sure what that refers to. [ACTION] talk to marissa [STATE] Marissa fiddles nervously with her blouse. It strikes me how unnecessarily frilly the thing is; she certainly has plenty to fiddle with. "Is it not by the bedside? I must've forgotten, sorry. A minute..." I watch her patter down the hallway and dart into my room. Her desire to take care of me seems more genuine than is warranted - or deserved, I catch myself thinking. Before last month, we had not seen each other since sixth form at college, years ago. She had no real reason to help me, no real reason to bring me to her home today. On the other hand, it seems pointless to question her motives when I'm unable to clarify even my own. Last night... I didn't know what to do. She just happened to be the one I remembered. Maybe I thought I could be anonymous here. Safe. Maybe I just knew she'd be unable to refuse. I see Marissa walking back down the hall towards me, an odd look on her face. A vague look, I think. Something approaching regret stirs in me - maybe it's my own unease that has flustered her into losing keys. "Here," she says, dropping the key into my expectant palm, "I'm sorry." I manage to suppress a grimace as she places a well-meaning hand on my injured arm. "I know having a key must be important to you now," she goes on, "but... you'll be safe here, you know. I don't think anyone could have followed us." [1] "Thank you for understanding." [2] "I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you." [3] "It's difficult to be certain of that. Thanks for the key."
