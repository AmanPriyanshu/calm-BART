Then, it was about Hogwarts College--not Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--and it was all about how Hogwarts provides extensive bursaries for nearly all its students, and how they follow a unique educational programme, focusing on life skills and personal interests. And the pictures didn't move--and there certainly wasn't a picture of students flying around on broomsticks--and the section about Hogwarts's history didn't mention that most of the historical alumni still live there as ghosts.

When you were a small child, your parents' house had one just like it. Your mother never liked to cook--for her, a family meal meant going round the corner for curry take-away instead of actually sitting down in a restaurant--but whenever your grandmother came to visit, she'd make the most incredible meals on that crummy old thing. You can still practically taste everything--she did all the standards, a roast one day, bubble and squeak the next, tarts and scones and pies. Unfortunately, she never taught you any of it.

After a brief, stomach-churning journey, you find yourself somewhere quite different--and no longer clutching the shoe. You must have lost it on the way. Dumbledore's Office A circular room with a high, vaulted ceiling.

Before you have a chance to say anything, even to exclaim in surprise, he shouts in a singsong voice, "Oi! It's the new Muggly-girl!" He dances around--surprising, how he can manage to dance in midair--to hover with his feet just on the level of your nose. "I, of course, am Peeves the Proper, King of this castle. Bet you're wondering what's going on, aren't you? Eh-eh-eh?" The bells on his hat jingle. "Yeah, uh, starting with -" you begin, but he cuts you off. "There once was a lazy headmaster who thought he could cast a spell faster. But the corners he cut slammed dimension doors shut and now he's a missing spellcaster!" "Get out of here, Peeves," Scamander says. "I'll call the Bloody Baron!" To your surprise, the threat seems to work: Peeves disappears as quickly as he came. All right. So Dumbledore tried to cast a spell and everybody disappeared, including him. That makes... well, it makes a weird kind of sense. It seems like you have a couple of options--you could try to fix the spell, even though you're not magical, or you could try to figure out where you are and start walking home.
