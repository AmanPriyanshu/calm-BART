They arranged an apprenticeship to a wizard, but learning magic is a slow, arduous process. In the year you've worked for Dr. Mortemain, you've only managed to learn a single spell. You've dutifully completed the chores he gives you (usually involving petty acts of larceny against his rival wizards), but you're growing impatient, and you're always looking for something better. That thing turned out to be a giant, fire-breathing dragon. The otherwise pleasant town of Blackacre has been terrorized for the last few months by a dragon that sweeps in, burns down farmsteads and devours livestock, then retreats to the safety of its mountain lair. The town council is finally organizing a hunting party to defeat the dragon, and it needs someone to lead it. After weeks of pleading, Dr. Mortemain deigned to let you interview with the council to run the expedition, but only in exchange for stealing some important letters that are apparently stashed in the castle. (You didn't ask for the details; Dr. Mortemain doesn't like explaining himself, and you didn't want him to rescind his permission.)

"You've already done your interview," he says, and you wince as you remember it, "so that's it. You may go." It isn't a request. The Guild, though just as firm, was kinder. They arranged an apprenticeship to a wizard, but learning magic is a slow, arduous process. In the year you've worked for Dr. Mortemain, you've only managed to learn a single spell. You've dutifully completed the chores he gives you (usually involving petty acts of larceny against his rival wizards), but you're growing impatient, and you're always looking for something better. That thing turned out to be a giant, fire-breathing dragon. The otherwise pleasant town of Blackacre has been terrorized for the last few months by a dragon that sweeps in, burns down farmsteads and devours livestock, then retreats to the safety of its mountain lair. The town council is finally organizing a hunting party to defeat the dragon, and it needs someone to lead it. After weeks of pleading, Dr. Mortemain deigned to let you interview with the council to run the expedition, but only in exchange for stealing some important letters that are apparently stashed in the castle. (You didn't ask for the details; Dr. Mortemain doesn't like explaining himself, and you didn't want him to rescind his permission.) The interview turned out to be what you should have expected, but at least the council won't announce its decision until noon. You still have some time left.

Her clients are from rich families and have elderly, sick relatives. They want to inherit, but they're obligated to do something to help. Sandie is that something. She performs the perfunctory duties of an attendant magician, but her lack of talent with magic eliminates the possibility of any inconvenient recovery. She sadly informs the dutiful sons or daughters that nothing can be done; they inherit a large sum of money shortly thereafter; and then they donate a modest fraction of that sum to Sandie in gratitude for her services. As such, most of the items in the shop are gaudy, sparkly trinkets of no use or value. A stuffed alligator even hangs gratuitously from the ceiling. To maintain plausible deniability, though, Sandie keeps some genuinely magical items in her shop. Having the occasional wizard as a customer makes her consulting activities more plausible, and she tries to keep you and Dr. Mortemain as loyal customers.

They are particularly useful in spells locating quarry in caves or underground, due to their predilection for burrowing. [ACTION] south [STATE]  Guild Street (West) As its name implies, Guild Street contains most of the town's guildhalls. There are far fewer now than a century ago, when the street was originally constructed, as the daily administration of the town became concentrated in the nearby castle. The ominous stone tower standing to the north was formerly the base of operations of the once-prominent Magicians' Guild, which counted dozens of wizards among its members in its heyday. That heyday passed centuries ago, however, and the only wizards currently in town are you and Dr. Mortemain. He acquired the tower after the guild's dissolution, and it's there that you now spend most of your time. The street returns to the town square to the west and continues to the east. You can see a tarnished brass mailbox here. [ACTION] west

Although it's no longer central in terms of geography or importance, this area is nevertheless a genuinely pleasant part of town. A clock tower dominates the plaza, towering over the cedars planted around it. Benches surround the flowerbeds that dot the square. Blackacre residents occasionally filter through the square, glancing up nervously at the overcast sky. Streets leave the square to the east and west, and a road to the south leads from the town of Blackacre to the castle of Blackacre. Among the crowded buildings ringing the square are the post office to the north and magic store to the southwest. [ACTION] southwest

[ACTION] southwest [STATE]  Magick Shoppe Blackacre's only magic shop looks the part: It's a musty, timbered building with some feeble light oozing in through its rafters. Its owner, Sandie, was formerly an undistinguished apprentice wizard; now she uses both that title and her ineptitude with magic for considerable financial gain. Her clients are from rich families and have elderly, sick relatives. They want to inherit, but they're obligated to do something to help. Sandie is that something. She performs the perfunctory duties of an attendant magician, but her lack of talent with magic eliminates the possibility of any inconvenient recovery. She sadly informs the dutiful sons or daughters that nothing can be done; they inherit a large sum of money shortly thereafter; and then they donate a modest fraction of that sum to Sandie in gratitude for her services. As such, most of the items in the shop are gaudy, sparkly trinkets of no use or value. A stuffed alligator even hangs gratuitously from the ceiling. To maintain plausible deniability, though, Sandie keeps some genuinely magical items in her shop. Having the occasional wizard as a customer makes her consulting activities more plausible, and she tries to keep you and Dr. Mortemain as loyal customers. Your jaundiced eye notices a display case that looks invitingly dusty. The store continues to the south, and the exit back to the town square is to the northeast. A golem stands at the exit.

Its owner, Sandie, was formerly an undistinguished apprentice wizard; now she uses both that title and her ineptitude with magic for considerable financial gain. Her clients are from rich families and have elderly, sick relatives. They want to inherit, but they're obligated to do something to help. Sandie is that something. She performs the perfunctory duties of an attendant magician, but her lack of talent with magic eliminates the possibility of any inconvenient recovery. She sadly informs the dutiful sons or daughters that nothing can be done; they inherit a large sum of money shortly thereafter; and then they donate a modest fraction of that sum to Sandie in gratitude for her services. As such, most of the items in the shop are gaudy, sparkly trinkets of no use or value. A stuffed alligator even hangs gratuitously from the ceiling. To maintain plausible deniability, though, Sandie keeps some genuinely magical items in her shop. Having the occasional wizard as a customer makes her consulting activities more plausible, and she tries to keep you and Dr. Mortemain as loyal customers. Your jaundiced eye notices a display case that looks invitingly dusty. The store continues to the south, and the exit back to the town square is to the northeast. The floor here has a small crack in it, through which the powdered skink fell. A golem stands at the exit. [ACTION] poke skunk

There are far fewer now than a century ago, when the street was originally constructed, as the daily administration of the town became concentrated in the nearby castle. The ominous stone tower standing to the north was formerly the base of operations of the once-prominent Magicians' Guild, which counted dozens of wizards among its members in its heyday. That heyday passed centuries ago, however, and the only wizards currently in town are you and Dr. Mortemain. He acquired the tower after the guild's dissolution, and it's there that you now spend most of your time. The street returns to the town square to the west and continues to the east. You can see a tarnished brass mailbox (which contains a lemon-colored envelope) here. A tinny but catchy song issues from the mailbox: Please pick up your mail! Before it gets too stale!

"What is that sssmell? "Oh, sorry. There was a skunk, and..." Flux delicately sniffs the powder again. "Bah, I can't sssmell anything else. Are you sssure thisss is the ssskink?" "Of course. The proprietor of the magic shop gave it to me herself." It snorts and flaps its wings in frustration. "Fine, fine." It resignedly accepts the pouch and flies off with it deeper into the tower.

You spent the first two weeks as Dr. Mortemain's apprentice here, grudgingly falling asleep early each morning after spending the day and night reading through the mountain of the books piled around the room. Even now, you've only covered a small fraction of the maze of tipping bookcases that stretch to the ceiling and crowd around the reading area. In this quiet and undisturbed area, redolent of old books, you've spent the happiest part of your year in the tower. If you have to leave, exits lead in all four directions to the other wings. Flux perches on the lectern, hissing excitedly. A lectern stands in an empty space near the center of the room. "Come on, come on," squeaks Flux, flying off to the east. [ACTION] east
