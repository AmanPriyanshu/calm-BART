Unfortunately, that was precisely what had just happened to Jack that night. Jack was on his way to the camp he had been ordered to, but he suspected that he must have taken a wrong turn somewhere -- easy enough to do with so many signposts taken down in case of a German invasion. Then just to cap it all, his car had just broken down, leaving him stuck out in in the middle of nowhere (or somewhere on the outskirts of Salisbury Plain, which amounted to much the same thing), still miles away from where he was meant to be. Long Road Jack was standing in the middle of a long road running roughly east-west between thick hedgerows.  His car lay abandoned about a few hundred yards up the road to the east.  Further to the east the road ran across miles of open countryside (as Jack knew because he'd just driven across it). [ACTION] examine me

A long, old-fashioned cooking range runs along the east wall, while doors lead off to west, south and north, a calendar being attached to the last of these. Hilda stops in the middle of the kitchen and turns to face me. "You are wondering what a German woman is doing in this house," she remarks.  "I tell you.  I am a Jew, and Germany is no good for Jews now.  I leave Germany two years ago and come here.  Too many Jews disappearing back home, and very bad things happen to them.  So that why I come here.

Landing North At first sight, this part of the landing has a rather higgledy-piggledy appearance, with doors leading off in all directions, the space being divided by the stair banister, and the landing continuing past the banister to the south.

Mr Croxley looks much as he does in the flesh, suggesting that the photo is fairly recent.  The young man in the picture closely resembles that in the picture of Tony Croxley in the drawing room.  The three women in the picture are less familiar.  All three have dark, curly hair, worn a bit shorter on the older woman than the younger two.  The older woman strikes me as being a bit plain, while the younger two, though sufficiently like her to be her daughters, look moderately pretty. [ACTION] look under bed

I'm sorry I haven't written more, but things have been a bit hectic here lately - Jerry isn't giving us much rest I'm afraid.  Still, I bagged a couple of Messerschmitts yesterday, and I think I winged a Heinkel too.  If I carry on at this rate old Hermann will run out of aircraft to send at us!
