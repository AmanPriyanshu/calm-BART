A quick look over your shoulder shows that the man who's been chasing you since you left work is still behind you, but the look costs you seconds as you have to grab for the handrail to keep from falling.

In the dark nobody notices, not even the people you're running head to head with, you're dressed alike in the the same kind of raggedy clothing.
