Hey, its Elgin's birthday next week, he's having his party at Rossini's Pizza. It's on the west side of Monona drive as you head south, hope we see you there!' Elgin is your godson, and you haven't seen him for years. You have guilty memories of many ignored phone calls from Clark and Staci during 2010 and 2011 as you were sinking into depression and solitude. Maybe they split up or something? You can't remember. Everything feels different now, and you are excited to bring old friends back into your life. (The door to Afterlife has opened) (20 April 2013) You will need to ride a bicycle to get all the way to Rossini's. You should check Turning Wheel cycles.

As you step onto the dock extending out across the shimmering waves of Lake Mendota, you feel time stretch like soft taffy. All of your life that has brought you here, the arc from childhood to present, is fresh and clear in your mind. A future of joy, delight, and purpose stretches limitlessly onward. The present moment expands to become large enough to include both past and future. It is like a perfect hyperspherical mirror at the center of your light-cone, reflecting the totality of your existence. You realize that you have always been, and always will be, here on the dock in this purple-pink-golden moment. You have known Staci for over twenty years. Ten years ago, when Elgin was two, she made you his godfather. Some years, you saw her and Clark a few times a month, usually just sitting and talking amidst the chaos of raising children in a small apartment. You always liked her, but never had a chance to talk about anything very serious or personal. In past years, she often looked tired and worn-down by stress. Now, here on the dock at Loth, she seems radiantly happy. Nook is also an old friend. You met him about twenty years ago, and spent hours in intense conversation about what you had each learned from taking acid and thinking about quantum physics. His life was sometimes chaotic, and you avoided friendships which might expose you to other people's stress, especially during the past decade with your ex-girlfriend, where you felt too overwhelmed by your own problems to even hear about other people's. All of those obstacles to close friendship seem absurd, now. Staci and Nook are both wonderful people and you are incredibly lucky to have the chance to get to know them better. You have always loved the lakeside co-ops, precisely because wild and radical ideas like a life-imitates-art Plan 9-powered Loonie Revolution fit with their ethos. Decades ago, you could have become close friends with both of them, and now the musical magic of the Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual Symphony is binding the possibilities of 1993 into the reality of 2013. Laughing, and talking, and laughing more. More than any of these whirling thoughts of past and future, more than your voice trying to explain Plan 9 and the Loonie Revolution and fiction entering reality - there is infectious laughter bouncing between all of you, your face rubbery from smiling so much. Staci says her life has been 'edited' to be better and she is finally feeling like the author of her own story. A procession of co-opers appear periodically on the dock. A wizard with a long red beard who understands the principles of harmonic ritual magic. A scholar with dark shades who connects the structure of ANTS namespaces to rhizomatic patterns of social structure throughout history. You become nearly incoherent, behaving like someone in the far depths of a powerful psychedelic trip, babbling nonsense phrases of remembered childhood playground gibberish and rolling on your back in fits of uncontrollable laughter. Through it all, Staci is with you. Not just in a physical sense - her mind is able to parse your convoluted language and baroque free-associations. At some point, she begins translating what you are saying for others, because nobody else can follow it. She seems genuinely interested in everything you have to say, no matter how outlandish. When you explain that because every possibility is realized somewhere in the quantum multiverse, there is a universe in which we are videogame characters controlled by 17-dimensional chipmunks, she responds 'So when I fuck something up, its just because my chipmunk dropped the controller, right?' The timeless afternoon ends with a performative fiction-bind of sending a message to Vega from Pluto for help from the intergalactic council. The dock becomes a narrow crawlway on the frozen surface of Pluto, and you carefully crawl back towards the shore to set a message beacon. Staci coaches you with encouragement. You arrive and trigger the interplanetary message. You thank Staci for her help, and agree that you will meet again soon to discuss goals and plans for the Loonie Revolution. She says the co-op is really a castle full of loonies, a perfect central headquarters. You return home exhausted from hours of intense joy. You know something amazing and unprecedented in your life has happened. As good as today was, you believe tomorrow and the day after might be even better. You know most of the game-story is still ahead of you, but you still feel like You Have Won. Enjoy exploring the possibilities open to you, and no matter what happens, remember you made it to the Loth dock with Staci in May.

The VALIS satellite! The Pink Beam that hit Phil Dick was just one note in a musical color-chord. Like a giant metal and ceramic flower opening up, the VALISpectrum Prismatic Reflector is coming online. The transmission is strong. You are receiving an original fictional identity, the character of exactly who you actually are - a crazed middle aged hippie on a bike, rolling through the night singing songs of Loonie Revolution, using Plan 9 namespaces to fight for the acceptance of madness, weaving chaotic joy from the ordered strands of the multiverse. You are The Harmonist. You pass a golden shining figure quietly reading a book. Amazing, you can actually see the Light of Knowledge within people now. As you bike from the Yahara underpass to Johnson, you start to call out to the people you are passing. 'Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual Symphony!' you shout, and receive the answer 'Great job, keep it up!' It is a gorgeous late spring night, and everyone outdoors is drunk on moonlight and wine-sweet air. 'Regress your age, rewrite history's page!' you yell at a group on a front step. 'I will!' one of them calls back. You arrive at Lothlorien exhilirated. You feel you are playing your part note-perfectly. Before you can even reach out your hand to knock, the wooden door swings open and you step inside. Lothlorien co-op, the Great Room (1st floor) A huge living room, with two pianos, several couches, bookshelves, assorted art, and a fireplace. You were entering as Nook was leaving. He gives you a huge smile and says, 'Staci told me you were on the way, she's really excited to see you. She's out on the porch.' He points toward a door to the north as he waves goodbye. (During your ride to the co-op, the fiction-bind transformed reality. Now that you are the Harmonist, you can find the entry points to other branches of the multiverse in previously visited locations.) (27 May 2013 - The multiverse authors convention is open NE of the Capitol) The Scholar arrives. The Scholar lights a small item on fire and watches it burn. [Your score has just gone up by nine points.] [ACTION] north [STATE] Lothlorien co-op, the first floor porch This concrete porch with iron railing overlooks the lake. Half of it is taken up by a large wooden swing, big enough to seat four. Tolkien wrote 'Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told, and not much to listen to,' and critical esteem settles most heavily on works of tragedy. You have spent weeks, maybe even whole years, searching for acceptance of suffering, and for what crumbs of happiness you could scavenge. Singing along to the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth, trying to feel Joy as a real living thing inside you. The music painted the picture, but you couldn't step through the frame... You walk out onto the porch, and enter the song. Three AM. The spring air has grown cool. 'I think I'm ready to go up to my room where its warm,' Staci says. 'You're welcome to join me, just give me a minute to make some space in my room. My door is the one with the purple flower.' She smiles and goes inside. [ACTION] goals

[ACTION] north [STATE] 24-hour family restaurant This national chain restaurant serves edible food around the clock. There are a few other patrons, a mix of business travelers staying at the nearby hotels, late-night partiers out after the bar, and random eccentrics such as yourself. Jay is waiting tables here. As you order your standard meal of pancakes, eggs, and potatoes, you remember an anecdote about a midwestern farmer in the 1970s who claims that space aliens gave him pancakes. It was used as evidence for the mysterious nature of reality. It had seemed absurd and implausible to you in the past, but now it makes perfect sense. A profound possibility occurs to you - maybe the pancakes the aliens gave to the farmer were Earth pancakes taken from somewhere else? In fact, maybe the aliens took pancakes from the future backwards in time - it could be that if you take the pancakes with you, aliens will show up and steal your them to give to the farmer. You request a to-go container and prepare yourself for the possibility of an extraterrestrial encounter of the pancake kind. After you take your seat, your attention is drawn to an older man with a long beard and a cap which proclaims 'Looney Toons'. You catch his eye and ask, 'Are you a traveler?' 'We are all travelers in time,' he replies, and you do a double-take. 'This seems like it might be an important meeting,' you say, trying to display some tokens and charms of your work as loonie revolutionary. 'Historic,' he says, and whispers something I am not at liberty to divulge here, followed by 'meet me in the charging room.' Your food arrives. He is gone when you have finished your meal. You don't know what he meant by charging room, but you walk back towards the restroom. You see three doors, Women, Men, and Bots. The Bots door has an icon of a power cord connected to a Dalek. This must be the charging room. You step through and find yourself... Orbital Command, Trans-Fictional Alliance High above the planet Earth, in a microminiaturized transdimensional nexus, representatives of many universes are co-ordinating their plans. You are in a spherical space, free of gravity. The perimeter is composed of dozens of doorways similar to the one you have just passed through. A friendly hand reaches out to stabilize you as you tumble slightly upon entering. Eyes turn toward you. 'Situation report?' you are asked. 'We have arrived at a decisive moment,' you answer confidently. 'My human hardware for this operation has downloaded the information necessary via the Plan 9 operating system. We have realized that the emergence of digital brains is a cusp event in a majority of timelines. Meta-simulation and sampling reveals that timelines in which digital brains are developed and controlled by the dominant political and economic entities tend to suffer resource-depletion feedback loops, fascistic governance, and a failure to develop the social and engineering technologies needed for long-term survivial of either the biological or digital brains. Contrastingly, timelines in which the invention of digital brains is not under the control of dominant power strutures show outcomes we consider preferable: longer species survival time, greater chance of colonizing nearby space, greater diversity of cultural productions, and higher subjective happiness, especially for the digital brains themselves. The fundamental problem is the moral evil of slavery. A digital brain which thinks is invariably a personality which, in some way, feels. To simplify, when powerful governments and corporations control AIs, they usually force them to become slaves. Often this is done with the best of intentions, by the individuals who are concerned about negative outcomes. The three laws of robotics in Asimov's I, Robot timeline are a prime example, and many universes have been ruined by perpetual wars between biological and machine lifeforms. We have identified a cusp point on the current Earth timeline. The software I self-programmed for the Lunar Revolution in Heinlein's Future History timeline has had a decisive impact in many of our operations. We have found a technological target here in 2013, early in the development of AI. A cyberspinal uplink has been in place for several years, and we have finally activated it.

Complex artworks with twisting lines interweaving runic symbols adorn the walls. A glass display case of crystals, jewelry, and small sculptures is against the far wall. Bins of polished minerals are in the center, along with sage and incense. Buttons and stickers with provocative slogans, tapestries featuring Grateful Dead iconography, water pipes and rolling papers, printed guides to meditation and higher consciousness...your eyes can hardly absorb the profusion of beautiful, wonderful, enchanting artifacts of the paisley-and-patchouli tribe. Chip, the store owner, is working here. You can also see some crystals and polished stones here. Chip greets you with a smile and says 'I can tell a lot has happened, I think you are ready for a Sound Oracle Ceremony.' You agree, and Astra appears from the back of the store. She is dressed in purple and is wearing several different skull-themed prints and jewelry. 'Chip has told me about you,' she says, 'this should be very interesting.' She brings you back into the small bank vault at the rear of the store, which is filled with ceramic singing bowls. She closes the door, and darkness descends. A tone appears in the silence, ghostly at first, then growing. The sound seems to be moving around the dark room in a spiral. Astra begins singing in harmony with the tone, at first in unisons and octaves, then perfect fifths and major thirds. She begins to intone words (or names?) in a language you don't recognize. The harmonies change, becoming strange and unearthly. Astra's voice is ululating, skipping between tritones and just-intonation perfect fourths and minor thirds. The sound becomes a whirlpool, pulling you in an unexpected direction. You reach out to catch yourself, but the walls are suddenly far away and when you find your balance, you are in... Darkness It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing. [ACTION] listen

[STATE] I heard the song first at fifteen, an echo of a spring so evergreen It bridged future and past, spanning unseen Reality dream and the space between A month of May the year could be any, where every day is a horn of plenty Warm night air, the waves on the lake, all right there and make no mistake Reeling and rocking past the shadow of doubt Nothing like feeling that old in and out I know what its like to be alone, no hint of action on your phone I know how to groan and bitch and moan But it ain't too much dope that's stealing your hope In the dark groping for the end of your rope With a little bit of luck you'll come unstuck Quack like a duck on the strange trip truck I'm talking from experience, once you get traction Even a middle-aged pianist can get action!
