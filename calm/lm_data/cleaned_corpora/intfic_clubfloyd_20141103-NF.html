Initially there were far from enough helmets to equip every man, so they were designated as "trench stores, to be kept in the front line and used by each unit that occupied the sector. It was not until the summer of 1916, when the first 1 million helmets had been produced, that they could be generally issued. The Brodie helmet reduced casualties but was criticized by General Herbert Plumer on the grounds that it was too shallow, too reflective, its rim was too sharp, and its lining was too slippery. These criticisms were addressed in the Mark I model helmet of 1916 which had a separate folded rim, a two-part liner, and matte khaki paint finished with sand, sawdust, or crushed cork to give a dull, non-reflective appearance. : [ACTION] exit

You are getting nearer them as you trudge on. You'll be damn glad to get settled down, whatever that may mean. You hope you'll at least be able to rest your feet. One thing for sure: Once the weather is dry, it won't be too bad once you reach the trench. You almost feel as if you've come home. No one back in bloody London understands for one moment,what you have to go through out here and you don't want to enlighten them. They ask question after question but they would never understand what your world out here is like. It begins at the gun lines. That inevitable fear and yet, you feel at one with your men. There's a closeness there, with the regulars anyway. These new boys. How long will they last? They fall like flies out here. At last, you swing into the trench area along with all your men and settle yourselves as best as you can. There's that crinkled crude iron fence at the side of the trench, there's the usual parapet and parados, the reasonably dry bottom of the trench and just about enough room to sit down if you're lucky. Since you are the Corporal, you get a slightly better place to sit than do most of your men. The sound of distant ragged gunfire from the front is getting restless. The guns seem disturbed like a swarm of bees. Main Trench The Latrine is northeast of here. To northwest are a Communication Trench and a Dugout. No Man's Land is to the west. The atmosphere is tense, since you never know when the next shell might bury you under the earth of your dugout. Fortunately, this is one of the stronger ones and it can resist shell fire, for a short while anyway. : [ACTION] northwest
