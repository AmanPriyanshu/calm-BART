(If it is, I can give you some background and instructions on what to do.) >> Yami-nabe (literally translated as "hot pot of darkness") is a variation of hot pot dish where members of a party can bring their own ingredients to put in a hot pot. The hot pot is cooked and eaten in the dark, so anyone can add whatever they want without getting caught! And because it's dark, you won't know what you get until you taste it, so you might be in for some surprises! When we begin, you can put any ingredient you want by sending the command "ADD [ingredient]". Of course, it wouldn't be very much of a secret if everyone knows what you're adding, right? So instead of typing the command "F ADD [ingredient]", you can type "WF ADD [ingredient]" to secretly add the ingredient you want. When you're ready to eat, just send the command "EAT" to try something that was added to the pot! We will automatically finish up once there is nothing left in the pot, but if you'd like to end earlier, you can type "DONE" to finish and see what was remaining. [ACTION] wf add carrots
