[STATE] Taken. You hear the wail of distant sirens. [ACTION] east [STATE] 19th Street You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street. A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room. The front entrance is north of you. The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically. A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak. An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door. [ACTION] north

[ACTION] north [STATE] Dining Room The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east. A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance. On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here. An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door. Angela lies dead on the floor. Nikolai's remains are scattered throughout the room. Sofia hovers several feet above the dining room tables, lapping blood from Nikolai's remains. [ACTION] kill sofia with letter opener

[ACTION] kill sofia with letter opener [STATE] Though it feels awkward to strike with your left hand, the letter opener slides into Sofia's chest as easily as a hot knife through butter.  Sofia's mouth drops.  Her expression speaks a sense of betrayal.  Then her body is overcome with epileptic seizures.  You are deafened by a momentary blast of thunder.  Sofia has disintegrated. Nothing remains but fly-size specks of blood and tissue painted against walls and ceiling. You race to your car to vacate the neighborhood before police arrive. You read in the newspaper the next day that police are unable to explain the carnage and gore they discovered at Nikolai's Bar and Grill that morning.  Police are still looking for the culprit. As for you, you are happy to have destroyed a coven of vampires.  It is a shame that you became afflicted by the means of Sofia's kiss. Now every night you find yourself trolling the streets for your own stable of victims. *** You have won *** Nikolai's Bar and Grill earned a final sanitation rating of -113.
