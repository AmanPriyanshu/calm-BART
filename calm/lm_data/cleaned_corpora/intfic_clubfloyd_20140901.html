So fast, you couldn't breathe. Then just before you struck the ground, you woke gasping for breath. A strange thing to happen, you had thought, that your mind could conjure such terrible illusions and you believed them, never in doubt. Later that day, you learned of Uncle Earl's passing. The doctors said he stopped breathing in his sleep. Mother blamed the doctors of course, saying no man with so robust an appearance should die without any forewarning.

Athena descends and hovers by your shoulder. * shoulder. * Chapter II Of the uncertainty after all You find yourself in a clearing surrounded by trees—but no! What you mistook for trees are wooden planks, just as tall and jutting from the gray earth at steep angles. A rocky hill rises beyond the clearing. "What luck!

He waves northward at the peak about the town. "'Twas an accident." "You may think so. Still, I am here to investigate." He looks as if he will argue for a moment, then sighs and taps his pipe. "I...I'll ask around. I can give you something tomorrow, mayhaps." You could ask who was murdered or ask about a possible cult link. [ACTION] ask who was murdered

After finally reaching this place after the seeming endless journey up from the valley, then up through the town, you feel a wave of exhaustion wash over you. In its wake, the idea of sleep seems irresistable. [ACTION] sleep

The featureless expanse reaches from horizon to horizon, the grey above it only slightly lighter than the grey below. You sense more than see the slight perturbations in the plane, one in each of what you think of as the cardinal directions. Three - north, east, and west - are morphological: an echo of Diahl to the west, a memory of home to the north, and...to the east -- yes, it definitely is. The familiar sensation of Silenus.

Pavilion Here the grey lightens and hardens until it is pure white marble beneath your feet, inlaid with precious stones and pieces of mirror. A raised path, also of marble, leads to the center. Beyond it, to the east, five arches are sketched into perilous existence. The path ends in a platform of deep red brick, topped in marble. Upon the platform is a wrought iron table. Seated at the table, as if nothing has happened and no time has passed, sits Silenus, shuffling and laying out a deck of cards. "Ah here he is now, the good Brother," it says, looking up from its task as you approach. "Following each and every one of Jumaht's commands with the constancy of a trained sheepdog." It gives the impression of a wry smirk. "Good boy. Sit. Stay." You could insult it back, say to it orders are important or ask where it has been. [ACTION] examine silenus

Yes, you have not managed to reach lucidity since your last night in the capital, but you lost track of Silenus long before then. The implications of this are disturbing: either Silenus is lying - which is, to your knowledge, impossible - or it cannot remember disappearing. Still, this is the most coherent you have ever seen Selenus. You do not know if that is a good or a bad thing. You could ask about this place, ask how it is feeling or ask about the cards.
