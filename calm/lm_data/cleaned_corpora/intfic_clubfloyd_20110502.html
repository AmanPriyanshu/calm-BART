He helps you through the door. Deck The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires, silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded. Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to face you. Although your voice is quite piercing, no one notices you. Davis leaps across the deck to your side, "Free me or she dies!" he yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, Captain Jamison draws his rapier, pulls you free and stabs. Davis slumps into a bloody heap. Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of being carried to the other ship, down a short flight of stairs, and laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the Falcon has left you in peace. You remain confined to this room, a large cupboard blocking the door. Meals are brought by a peg-legged old man and eaten in silence. Of your handsome rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.

A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots. Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the sea! Alas, your fate is sealed.

[ACTION] examine falcon [STATE] Jamison carries an aura of power unusual in men so slim and tall, the strength of a willow in his hard seaworn body, straight shouldered and resilient. Chestnut hair, tousled by the wind, frames the tanned oval of his face. A jagged scar etches one cheek, harsh against the warmth of his limpid blue eyes. To your surprise, the stranger bows. "Well met, my lady." His accent is cultured, his smile vibrant. "I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me." He chuckles at your glare of distrust.

[STATE] Quarterdeck No torches are lit, or needed on this moonlit night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation wheel. Men move about to the fore, talking quietly. Under the stairs aft to the poop is a barred door. The reefs are definitely getting larger. Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope. Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island. A sailor notices the "swish" of your petticoats. "A woman," he gasps, "free, aboard this ship!" It's been rather a long time since any of the crew have dealt with the fairer sex, and they are a bit rough, despite Rodney Quick's exhortations. ***   You have died   *** In 100 turns, you have achieved a score of 2 out of 25 points.

[STATE] "Welcome, ma petite." Lafond bows you in. Lafond's Bedroom Lafond's bedroom shows all the outpourings of his megalomania. Royal hues of purple and gold weigh down the hangings on the bed and the eastward window, as if trying to smother the moonbeam shining in. Lafond is leering, lip curled. A lace-covered table crouches beside a wing-backed chair in one corner. Sitting on the table is a green goblet, a blue goblet and a flagon. "Have some wine." Lafond pours wine into two glasses, giving a blue one to you. "Drink this down. We have a long night ahead of us." He drains his own. [ACTION] put laudanum in green goblet [STATE] Lafond bounds to your side, grabbing the leather bottle out of your hand before you can use it. "What have we here? Trying to poison yourself? Or me?" He throws it out the shutters. Lafond waits impatiently for you to drink. [ACTION] drink wine

Suddenly, the door slams open. It is Jamison, coatless, sword bared, his shirt ripped. "Thank God I am not too late. Leave, darling, before I skewer this dog to his bedposts," he cries. The scar on his cheek gleams coldly. With a yell, Crulley and the butler jump out of the darkness behind him. Nicholas struggles, but soon lies unconscious on the floor. "Take him to the dungeon," Lafond says, setting down his glass. "You, butler, stay nearby. I do not wish to be disturbed again. "Now that we are rid of that intrusion, cherie, I will change into something more comfortable. Pour me more wine." He crosses to the wardrobe removing his coat and vest, turned slightly away from you. [ACTION] pour wine in green goblet

As the gun fires, Cookie throws himself before his captain. He cries out, blood blossoming on his shoulder, and falls face first into the sand. Lucy runs to him. Jamison yells up the cliff, brandishing his sword. "Fight like a man, Lafond. You have drawn my blood once tonight -- let me draw yours." Lafond sneers. "On one condition. If I win, your lady comes to me. You will have no need of her when you are dead." Nicholas stiffens, glances at the dragoons on the cliff above, and turns slowly to you.

Lafond is pressed back into the shadow of the cliff, sweat beading on his forehead. Abruptly, Jamison leaps forward, metal scrapes, and his rapier licks neatly into Lafond's ribs, like a snake slipping into its burrow. The body of the governor of St. Sinistra convulses, as in amazement, then sags dead on the sword. Nicholas removes a gold ring from the dead man's finger, throwing his own cheap copy into the surf.

Nicholas turns and walks smiling towards you, oblivious to his danger. [ACTION] shoot crulley [STATE] Trembling, you fire the heavy pistol. You hear its loud report over roaring surf. Crulley staggers, hit, and falls from the cliff. The gun falls from your nerveless hands. Time stops as you and Nicholas gaze at one another, adoring and amazed. Slowly he bows and offers his hand. Chestnut hair, tousled by the wind, frames the tanned oval of his face.

"There I am but a destitute gentleman, wanted for piracy. Here -- this isle holds too many memories; your father may have it. Mayhap my brother's wife yet lives. I must try to find her, either way." He takes you into his arms. "Come with me, my love? To America -- they tell of endless fertile fields and strange beasts in that wild land. It won't be easy, but we will have each other.

The tale you tell Jamison's crew, of rapine and blood, of your heroic attempt to save their captain, and of your own escape after his death in your arms, is not so far from the truth that you cannot appear sincere.
