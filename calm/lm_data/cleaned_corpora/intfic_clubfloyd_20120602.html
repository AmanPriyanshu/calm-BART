[ACTION] read page [STATE]  There's a whole hash of universal warning symbols including a circle with a line through it--some poor stupid looking face is crossed out. There's also someone wearing a spacesuit next to a crossed-out stick figure that is not. There's a big exclamation mark in the upper right-hand corner--a pretty universal meaning. The slots on the left side are labeled A, B and C, from top to bottom (okay, they're unreadable glyphs. But you have to call them SOMEthing.) On the right, there's D, which you decide is a tab. B and D are parallel with the middle row, while A is close to the top row, and C is close to the bottom row. Would you like to see a physical representation? [ACTION] yes
