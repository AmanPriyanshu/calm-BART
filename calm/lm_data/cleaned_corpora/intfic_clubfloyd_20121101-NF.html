There's also an old garden shed with a yard hydrant installed next to it. [ACTION] remove weeds [STATE]  You get on your knees and pull each weed carefully out around the flowers. It takes a good thirty minutes, but the result looks really nice. Never mind the aching fingers. [ACTION] plant tomatoes

"Conan is the barbarian, the Significant Other against which civilisation defines itself." "To say that 'Conan Kill Everything' relies on symbolic vocabulary is to understate the issue. Its symbols are isolated and recognisable, and stand out from the landscape in their symbolic significance like a naked guy on steroids in a Victorian painting. 'Note this!' they say. And they are organised with a tidy symmetry, perfect and mathematical, so that the meaning of anything unexplained may be worked out by its relations to other symbols and the oppositions between them. The sword, the table, the worm, the penis; every object denotes a single concept in its purity." [ACTION] forum
