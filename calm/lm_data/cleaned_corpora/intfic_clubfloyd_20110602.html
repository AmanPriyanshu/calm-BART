Truth to tell, they're extremely unhappy. A bottle of vodka sails through the air. It's not an offer of a drink, since it was aimed at your head. It connects. You disconnect from your host and spin through the dimensions towards your new host. Castle Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless with ant eggs near the top and gravel at the bottom.

[STATE] Opah If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad. It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west. A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad.

He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills" or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east.

As a reward, we at the Department, are allowing you three month's vacation with a goldfish of your choice." He winks. "And we guarantee no interruptions this time." You are warped off to a spacious, warm aquarium with all the pondweed, ant eggs and gravel you could want. And of course, the most beautiful creature in all the dimensions to spend time with. After three months of this kind of pleasure, you might not be up to another mission... Your score is 491 out of 501. Do you want to quit or restart (q/r)? [ACTION] r [STATE] Are you sure (y/n)? [ACTION] yes
[STATE] Are you sure (y/n)? [ACTION] yes [STATE] "Well done, Agent 10," said Sir Playfair Panchax, head of Mission HQ. "We knew you'd stop the Seven Deadly Fins. Good show! It's a shame they got away again. But now I suggest you take a vacation. You've earned it, old boy." You agreed with him, the last few months had been a real chore. Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative isn't a bad life apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite relationships, but you need a spot of R and R every now and then, just to stay sane. So you went for the big one - warping into a goldfish for a whole month! The peace. The tranquility. And you're still on the payroll. FISH! - Version 1.10 - Copyright (C) 1988, 1990 Magnetic Scrolls Ltd. Someone's coming. Good, it must be time for food. SPLATTO. A hand as big as a bus drops something hard right on your head. Understandably dazed, you flip over and, through a swirl of ant eggs, spot what hit you: a tacky plastic castle. It looks like a rush job. Sir Playfair must be in trouble. And you thought you were on vacation... Goldfish Bowl Swimming upside down is good fun, but difficult, even for someone as highly trained as yourself. It looks like the pondweed is dangling from the gravel above your head. And the ant eggs, wow! Upside down they look, so, so much like, well, like exactly the same as if you were the right way up actually. Anyway, there's no need to get carried away. Sir Playfair has a message for you in the castle if you're not mistaken and he hates agents who are late. [ACTION] open glass box

And especially since there's a guy with a six-shooter on his belt, ready to draw, standing thirty feet away and facing you.  Your body keeps screaming at you that you should still be in bed.  The dimly lit cage of your memory tells you that all of this has something to do with you standing up for some woman in the saloon last night, and right now you wish like hell you could remember.
