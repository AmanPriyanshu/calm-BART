Twisted and stalactite-hung stone forms a vault overhead, which glimmers with reflections of some unseen source of light; but the canyon below is shadowed. Water rushes somewhere at its root. You could climb farther down, and a narrow crevice leads back into the rock. Movement, on a level area on the far side of the canyon, partway down. Something gliding silently back and forth, back and forth. Your prey. Waiting. [ACTION] examine prey [STATE] The creature does not look small, even from up here, even half-unformed by canyon shadows.

[STATE] You pull down the lever, winching the string back until it locks. [ACTION] shoot prey [STATE] Tunk. And you flinch at the hissing shriek that echoes up the cave walls. The dark shape flees -- not climbing, but running down the canyon slope, vanishing in the depths. Your thudding pulse slows. Moments later, barely sensed, the scent of blood. You have wounded the Wumpus. [ACTION] down

Your thudding pulse slows. Moments later, barely sensed, the scent of blood. You have wounded the Wumpus. [ACTION] down [STATE] You turn, test your balance, and begin edging down the slope. And your foot slips. Again. You fling your arms out, heedless of your possessions. You grasp at nothing. Much too tired for this, you think, as you skid wildly down the canyon. A danger to yourself and everyone around you. And below, you add with distant amusement, before the bottom arrives with a horrible jolt. [ACTION] space

And below, you add with distant amusement, before the bottom arrives with a horrible jolt. [ACTION] space [STATE] Base of Canyon You must be getting better at this. You're only freshly bruised. Lying still, even on cold stone, is painfully easy... but after a few minutes, you find yourself struggling to stand. You are in an alcove, a side chamber at the base of a vaulting canyon. The walls spread upward around you. And the distant roof is hung with glimmering stars -- droplet-tipped stalactites in some hidden suffusion of light. You think, against your will, that it was worth it. A crevice runs along the canyon at your feet. You can cross it and continue on ahead. The Wumpus certainly fled this way: a pool of thick, dark, reeking blood is spilled across the ground. Bats crawl all around it -- rustling, fluttering, feasting. A bat chitters angrily at its neighbor. [ACTION] wait

A path seems to climb up among them; but you don't think you can get to it right now. The Wumpus is crouched before you. Blood trickles from the wound your bolt tore, down its hide, puddling on the floor. It holds your crossbow in its claws; gently cradled; loaded and cocked; steady on your throat. [ACTION] wait
