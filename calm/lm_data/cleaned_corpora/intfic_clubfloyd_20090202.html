You slowly sit up, opening your eyes to an arid landscape of rocks and scrub. How did you get here? Then the memories erupt. Your parents' disappearance a month ago. Your discovery of their creations, suits that give you and your sister Emily fantastic superpowers. Using those powers to save your campus when longtime family friend Nina Icolari turned into a raging behemoth, transformed by a prehistoric bacteria sample gone amok. When Aunt Nina recovered, she also recovered memories that had been suppressed by mysterious interlopers, memories that led you and Emily to Professor Thaddeus Andrews' remote observation post in the Sierra Nevadas. There, you found an astonishing teleportation device, apparently built by your parents. The device took you to another world entirely, an artificially constructed planetoid built solely for the purpose of testing hyper-evolutionary bacteria, perhaps related to the microbes that affected Aunt Nina. Emily was transported to the other side of the planetoid's outer structure, where you found the alien scientist in charge of the experiment. That scientist explained to the two of you that his rival Esrrua had stowed a spy-creature aboard the experiment, and that Andrews had tried to intervene in the ensuing fight, only to be captured by Esrrua himself. Your parents had followed to rescue Andrews, pursuing the spy-creature through another teleportation portal... the same one that brought you here. But although Emily is beside you, struggling to her feet and no doubt reliving her own memories, your parents are nowhere to be seen.

Behind you is a transport tube entrance. All of Austin's attention is focused on holding up the polymer sheet. [ACTION] north [STATE] You scamper through the aperture, and Austin wrenches himself to the other side of the door. It slams shut when he lets go of it. Esrrua's Lab Even though this room is filled with clutter and equipment, it still has about as much open floor space as half a basketball court. A large window occupies much of its west wall, through which you can see another room, where one of the cat-aliens stands before a broad control panel. Byzantine machinery dominates all the other walls, and at the far north end of both rooms, a teleportation curtain shimmers and pulsates. Just behind you, to the south, the unbreakable polymer sheet once again blocks the exit. A monitor window floats in the air, displaying a view of the dilapidated road that winds just west of this fortress. Several clear chambers, one of which is filled with a swirling green cloud, reach to the ceiling. Austin stands next to you, his eyes taking in everything. In the center of the room stands another of the cat-aliens: a humanoid figure, well over seven feet tall and heavily muscled. It whirls to face you, and its oval-slitted eyes glare savagely. The creature bares its teeth, flattens its ears, and drops into a crouch. This can be none other than Esrrua. By Esrrua's side, a white, amorphous mass trembles, sending out eager pseudopods in your direction. The thing is large, as tall as Esrrua and half again as wide, but it is shapeless, constantly rippling its boundaries like a gigantic, puffy amoeba. "SO!" shouts Esrrua imperiously. "Still more apelings come to plague the progress of science! But you are too late! TOO LATE!" He turns toward the window and points at the control panel. "Maerr, release the bacteria!" Turning back to you, he curls his lip. "I will not taint my paws with your stink, dirty apelings, when my niarr can destroy you instead!" "DEVOUR THEM!" he shouts, and the white blob surges forward, long pseudopods writhing at its perimeter! [ACTION] zap blob

Blue lightning flows from your fingertips into the niarr, and for a moment, the creature grows rigid, processing the incredible energy of your blast. Then it swells, expanding to almost double its previous size. The niarr extends its tentacles again, apparently hungrier than ever! Meanwhile, your brother is pummeling the niarr, and the creature seems to swell with every blow. It's now about quadruple the size it was when you came in. Simultaneously, Maerr's paws skitter rapidly across the control panel, and a hissing sound fills the air. "Bacteria released!" he shouts triumphantly over an intercom, and the green gas roils upwards, disappearing from its chamber. A moment later, the monitor displays a hidden hatch opening in the ground next to the road, and a noxious cloud of viridian vapor spews forth! The cloud expands in all directions, not dissipating but rather multiplying, heading inexorably towards the towns and cities of New Mexico, ground zero for the upcoming worldwide infection. *** Humanity is doomed *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move or QUIT?

You see the cloud moving frantically, and hear the alien's voice over an intercom, crying, "Science Master Esrrua, I... I cannot see! I cannot trigger the release sequence!" "NOOOOO!" screams Esrrua. "I cannot be thwarted when I am so close! Apeling, I shall kill you myself!" With this, he springs forward, claws extended and reaching for your face! Meanwhile, you hear Austin's fist slam into the niarr with a muffled WHUMP! The skysuit's mask doesn't leave you much peripheral vision, but it's enough to tell you that the white mass is growing at an alarming rate, swelling in proportion to the force of your brother's blows.

His body flies backwards, its fur all stood on end, and lands in a heap just short of the teleportation curtain, still convulsing. Simultaneously, your brother directs a fierce karate kick at the niarr, and it lands with a booming WHUMP! Once again, the creature absorbs his blow, expanding like a water balloon hooked to a firehose! The niarr now takes up almost half the room, and it practically vibrates with absorbed energy. A thousand pseudopods shoot out from its edges, grasping at him! You hear an anguished, inarticulate scream over the intercom, and the sound of shattering glass. The cloud of fog is on the move, flowing through the broken window, and a screeching voice emerges from within it. "I cannot see you, murdering simians, but your stench is unmistakable!"

KA-BLAMMO! [Please press a key to continue] The explosion was so sudden, so overwhelming that there was no time to protect yourself, no time for anything but flying backwards into the wall. When the blackness in your head lifts, the room is much changed. The niarr is gone, though the walls are smeared with white goo and a sour smell hangs in the air. Gone as well are Esrrua and Maerr, apparently blown through the teleportation curtain shortly before it, too, disappeared.
