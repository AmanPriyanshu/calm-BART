Attack of the Yeti Robot Zombies This is a try-to-win-on-the-first-attempt game. The point of the game is to try to win on the first attempt. Or, failing that, to win in as few attempts as possible.

After waiting a while the chopper takes off. A couple of hours later you speak into the phone: "Ok, I am now flying over Drammen." "You are doing great. The headquarters of the evil boss is in a new building. It's the tallest one in Drammen, close to the middle of the city. Can you see it?" "Yes." It must be over a hundred stories tall, and it easily dwarfs any of the other buildings. On the sides it has huge neon pentagrams. On the roof is a 30-meter tall statue of a yeti robot zombie. "Be careful." says General Hansen. "There are rumors that the closest servants of the evil boss are a group of Satanists!" "Holy crap!" "Indeed. They are very deadly in combat. And don't think for a minute that you can reason with them. They are at least as dangerous as the yeti robot zombies." "Understood." You fly closer to the building. You notice that the eyes of the statue of the yeti robot zombie are moving. They are following your chopper! The statues mouth opens. A rocket shoots out, straight towards you! You steer the chopper down. You avoid a full hit. Instead the rocket explodes against the propeller. The chopper is going down fast! Frantically, you steer the chopper towards the building. It smashes into, and goes halfway through, the roof! The impact makes the chopper door open, and you fall out! You land painfully on the floor below. Groaning, you slowly get up. You look around. West side of a hall You are on the west side of large black hall. Above you the chopper is sticking halfway through the ceiling. You can go east. On the east side of the hall you can see the following: A large red metal barrel stands on the floor. On it is written, in large black letters: "DANGER! HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE!" A yeti robot zombie stands on one side of the barrel, a man on the other. He is wearing a hooded brown robe, which conceals his face. For some reason the yeti robot zombie shows no sign of wanting to attack the man. A doorway leads north. The man says "Ah, excellent. Another sacrifice to our master. But first a prayer." He begins to mutter something in Latin. [ACTION] inventory
