Bekenga, a young cow herder, ran into the middle of the congregation. The elders stared at him angrily; this was not the time for an interruption. But what he had to say quickly disrupted the ritual anyway. A whole herd of cattle had been stolen; one of the herders wounded and unconscious on the ground, in the scorching sun; the other, missing. This is of course a serious matter. Cattle theft is bad enough; kidnapping is unforgivable. Quickly, the elders had selected a group of warriors to find both herd and herder; and to your joy, you were one of them. That was twelve hours ago now. You have been tracking footprints across the plains, going with little food and water. You just hope you will find something, anything, soon.

The boat lies here, but you don't have the time to set it afloat. Instead, you jump directly into the cold water, swimming a safe distance from the shore. The wolves break out of the woods but they stop at the water, howling and hissing. It seems they are afraid of it; and you swim towards the Dagon unhindered. Quickly, strong hands pull you out of the water and you are escorted into the Captain's cabin. You quickly explain what happened; and though the story doesn't even sound convincing to yourself, Captain Davids believes you. "I have heard of werewolves in these parts, but a whole village? This evil must be stopped. I have the suspicion that this shaman you spoke of is the cause of this evil... if we manage to destroy him, maybe the others will be saved, too." You nod; it didn't seem that the villagers had any idea of what was going on when they were gathered to lynch you. "I have an idea. It is very dangerous, but it might work. In my library are certain old books; and one of them describes a salve that can transform a man into a wolf for some time." You nod grimly. "Let me do it." "Ranil! It is very dangerous! If you stay in wolf-form too long, you might not be able to ever become human again; and I do not know if your strength can match that of the shaman. But I can see in your eyes that you are determined to do it, and so I shall prepare everything. "I know it is only morning, but you must go and sleep now, for you will need all your strength later. I shall wake you around midnight." Again, you nod, and leave for your hammock in the ship's hold as Davids pulls a black-bound leather tome out of his book case. You lie down and quickly fall into a troubled sleep. [Strike any key to continue...] D A Y   T H R E E [Strike any key to continue...] Shortly after midnight, Davids gently shakes you awake. "I have prepared the salve, Ranil. I have to warn you again - it is very dangerous to stay in wolf-form too long. Are you sure you really want to do this? "Yes." Davids tells you to remove your clothes, then proceeds to rub the salve into your body. "I'm afraid his is going to hurt. Here," he hands you a piece of wood, "bite down on this." At first, you feel nothing. Then, a tingle runs over your skin, and then the pain hits you. You fall to the floor, your teeth grinding into the wood, your vision dimmed. Your breath comes in short gasps, and an explosion of pain makes you pass out for a few seconds. When you can think clearly again, you open your eyes. Everything is dark, except for a large red blotch in the center of your vision. You inhale deeply and an impossible number of sensations stream from all sides. Wood, salve, clothes, skin, flesh, blood. [Strike any key to continue...] You try to rise, but find you are too weak yet. Davids quickly holds your muzzle in both hands and ties some rope around it. "Sorry, boy, but I can't have you kill anyone yet." You growl at him, but he grabs you by the nape of the neck and leads you to one of the boats. It is quickly lowered and Davids rows you over to the shore. As you jump on the beach, Davids removes the rope and quickly makes for the Dagon again. "Kill him. And be back in two hours, or it may be too late." Beach The many different scents on the beach are overwhelming, but there is one that is stronger and more evil than all the others. [ACTION] smell
[STATE]  Finally, you reach the shore. The boat lies here, but you don't have the time to set it afloat. Instead, you jump directly into the cold water, swimming a safe distance from the shore. The wolves break out of the woods but they stop at the water, howling and hissing. It seems they are afraid of it; and you swim towards the Dagon unhindered. Quickly, strong hands pull you out of the water and you are escorted into the Captain's cabin. You quickly explain what happened; and though the story doesn't even sound convincing to yourself, Captain Davids believes you. "I have heard of werewolves in these parts, but a whole village? This evil must be stopped. I have the suspicion that this shaman you spoke of is the cause of this evil... if we manage to destroy him, maybe the others will be saved, too." You nod; it didn't seem that the villagers had any idea of what was going on when they were gathered to lynch you. "I have an idea. It is very dangerous, but it might work. In my library are certain old books; and one of them describes a salve that can transform a man into a wolf for some time." You nod grimly. "Let me do it." "Ranil! It is very dangerous! If you stay in wolf-form too long, you might not be able to ever become human again; and I do not know if your strength can match that of the shaman. But I can see in your eyes that you are determined to do it, and so I shall prepare everything. "I know it is only morning, but you must go and sleep now, for you will need all your strength later. I shall wake you around midnight." Again, you nod, and leave for your hammock in the ship's hold as Davids pulls a black-bound leather tome out of his book case.
