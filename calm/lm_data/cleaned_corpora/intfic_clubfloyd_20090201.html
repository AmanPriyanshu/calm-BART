E A R T H A N D S K Y Episode 2: ANOTHER EARTH, ANOTHER SKY [Please press a key to continue] It's been quite a week. Was it just two nights ago that you found the suits? You were searching through your parents' lab as usual, desperate for clues to explain their recent disappearance, when you found a latch on one of the machines. It opened, revealing two bodysuits crammed inside. One fit you perfectly. The other seemed to be made for your sister Emily. Hers, the "skysuit", gives her the power to fly, to generate thick fog, and to fire blasts of intense electrical energy, while your "earthsuit" has granted you the strength of a giant, and the invulnerability of a mountain. The powers came in handy the next morning, when your parents' best friend, Dr. Nina Icolari, found herself transformed into a raging, hundred-foot-tall monster. Aunt Nina had been working with some ancient bacteria, trapped for eons in a salt crystal, when an untimely earthquake shattered the crystal. She inhaled the microbes, became a behemoth, and only the power of your suits and your brains saved the campus from destruction. You employed a fast-acting antibiotic to reverse the transformation, and when she changed back, Aunt Nina realized that her memories of your parents' disappearance had been mysteriously altered... and that the trauma of metamorphosis had somehow restored them. Those memories have led you here, to a remote cabin in the Sierra Nevadas. Here, you hope that where the police have failed, Earth and Sky may succeed.

It's not the desk, or the computer, or the other laboratory accoutrements that make it so, but rather the staggeringly complex mass of ornate machinery that smothers every wall.

The faraway blue-green smudge is north, the faraway tan smudge south. Your views east and west are blocked by huge, rugged breccia hills. A deep crater is here, which is what happens when an immovable object like this glacier meets an irresistible force like a plummeting superhero. Beside the crater, a long metal tube reaches into the sky. The bottom of the tube has been entirely dislodged from its base, no doubt wrecked by your recent impact. That impact also appears to have exposed some sort of access panel. >The hole is probably twenty feet deep. If you were Wile E. Coyote, it would be shaped like an outline of your body, but instead it's more generally crater-like, though a deep crater rather than a wide one.

So you head back to where you stared from, thinking that there's got to be an easier way. [ACTION] leap north [STATE] You take a running start, get up to top speed, and then vault upwards. The ground drops away beneath you -- gravity is definitely less than 1G on this planetoid, though your mind boggles to think how dense the core must be in order to even come close. Your thoughts return to the present as the border of the arctic area approaches -- the demarcation between it and the adjoining areas is distinct and sharp. Incredibly, you've traveled almost 45 degrees across the sphere already, and your trajectory will take you another 45, to the side of the sphere, before you land. Always assuming, of course, that the borders are permeable. As the border passes beneath you, a momentary nausea sweeps over you, gone as soon as you enter the next area. You've reached the arc of your parabola, and have begun to descend. An ocean sloshes below you, uncluttered by islands or land masses. As the water approaches, you suddenly realize that some of the things you're carrying will be ruined if they get wet. Frantically running your hands along your costume searching for a pouch, your finger slides over a line that splits into an opening. Thinking quickly, you stuff the items inside, and run your finger along the line to close it again. Just in time, too, because you hit the water with a massive SPLOOSH! Once your head is submerged, a plastic sheath emerges from the sides of your cowl, covering your nose and mouth. You take a hesitant breath, and realize that the suit must be filtering oxygen from the water. Mom and Dad sure planned ahead when they made this thing! Unfortunately, they apparently weren't able to make it very lightweight, and you quickly sink to the ocean floor. Ocean You're standing on silty ground, deep underwater. The light is dim, but you can still see well enough, thanks to bioluminescence from plants that make their home here. Judging from the time you spent sinking, your rough estimate is that you're about two thousand feet below the surface. Happily, the suit seems equipped to handle such extreme pressures, and although you feel like you're moving in slow motion, you're experiencing no discomfort. A large circular door, apparently a hatch, is set in the ground here. Just alongside the hatch is a large, mirrored half-bubble, like a glassy eye in the sand.

By all rights, you should have a serious case of the bends after such a rapid ascent from deep underwater, but you feel fine -- the earthsuit must somehow have fooled your body into thinking it was still at one atmosphere of pressure, thus preventing nitrogen absorption.

Orienting yourself based on the direction you came from, you can see enormous sand dunes rising north and south of you, creating no shade but blocking your vision. Through the heat haze, you can barely perceive the Forest to the east, and the Veldt to the west. A large, Y-shaped cactus stands nearby, with a lens between its arms, creating a beam of concentrated sunlight aimed at the bowl. You can also see an enormous bowl (in which is a pile of sea salt) here. [ACTION] wear headset [STATE] You're already wearing that! [ACTION] push button

Seeing the look of incomprehension on your face, it stalks over to the other side of the room and twists a dial. When it speaks again, a hidden speaker broadcasts an English translation over its words. "You stupid, clumsy, vomit-brained, simian cub!" it resumes, "You did this, didn't you?" It gestures angrily at one of the blank screens. "You wrecked my Arctic equipment, and tramped your filthy body through every other environment! You've destroyed my work!"
