She was without San. [I pondered.] I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's stated desire.  Two of the requirements were a long and healthy life for her baby.  The undercurrents of her baby, lycanthropy and life span, were incompatible.  The were-fox undercurrent needed redirection at that point in time or be integrated fully soon after. [I pondered.  And for the first time, I could grant at least some of the wish without an associated "curse".] Her baby had strong undercurrents of happiness.  I would not need to do anything to grant that portion of the wish.  However, prosperity was another matter.  I could have channeled the undercurrents to make that happen, but not without cost.  I realized that I greatly risked Satisfaction if I attached a curse.  Perhaps there was treasure still remaining somewhere around the vaults that could assure prosperity. Through Will of Purpose, I continued channeling the undercurrents of the emerald. [ACTION] give emerald to baby [STATE] I could only do that to something animate. [ACTION] examine baby

[STATE] I dropped my undercurrent connection with the Deed of Nobility. [ACTION] grant wish [STATE] My recent exponential increase in Purpose evoked in me an awareness. The attractor winds that gave me control of the undercurrents were viewed as curses by my summoners.  By the time the summoner called upon me anew, any Satisfaction that might have been gained initially was eliminated by these curses. Why had Seegan been Satisfied?  I knew only one possibility.  She was without San. [I pondered.] I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's stated desire.  Two of the requirements were a long and healthy life for her baby.  The undercurrents of her baby, lycanthropy and life span, were incompatible.  The were-fox undercurrent needed redirection at that point in time or be integrated fully soon after. [I pondered.  And for the first time, I could grant at least some of the wish without an associated "curse".] Her baby had strong undercurrents of happiness.  I would not need to do anything to grant that portion of the wish.  However, prosperity was another matter.  I could have channeled the undercurrents to make that happen, but not without cost.

[STATE] My recent exponential increase in Purpose evoked in me an awareness. The attractor winds that gave me control of the undercurrents were viewed as curses by my summoners.  By the time the summoner called upon me anew, any Satisfaction that might have been gained initially was eliminated by these curses. Why had Seegan been Satisfied?  I knew only one possibility.  She was without San. [I pondered.] I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's stated desire.  Two of the requirements were a long and healthy life for her baby.  The undercurrents of her baby, lycanthropy and life span, were incompatible.  The were-fox undercurrent needed redirection at that point in time or be integrated fully soon after. [I pondered.

Sela stood near with mirror in hand. "The risk-reward is fair I feel I say to you we have a deal," said Sela. "How do I reach this 'Room' that you mention? And how shall I leave, by what convention?" I replied, "An earthly servant shall take you down First pack your bags and leave this town Meet it at the Heart of Clay It owes the mirror a favor, say When you reach the place of stands Where Destiny combines its strands Set me on the final top Make sure I stay, I must not drop The lamp awaits for whom would speak Its magic word, its name unique To leave the way your kind has done Just step into the middle sun On your trip if help is needed Pick me up for objects weeded" Sela set me down and presumably readied herself for her journey. [I waited.] My view was initially blurry because Sela had taken my mirror out quickly.  I heard a deeper voice in mid-sentence, "... inquiring about the death of Ayla Exeter."  Another voice offered, "It's a shame, it is.  With each passing day, she was becoming the most beautiful woman in the land.  I'd like to get my hands on the knave who gave her that poisoned apple." Sela brought up my mirror steadily and turned her back.  She offered sweetly, "Brave men, a second please brace.  Allow a poor woman a brief check of her face."  "Awww, you don't need t' do that m'lady. You're the most beautiful in the land," said the second guard. In a clear view by then, I could see two men slowly, very slowly, drawing conclusions from the conversation that had just transpired. The City Gates The road through the gates was narrow, the gates were made of steel. To her right was a bearded guard.  To her left was a bespectacled guard.  My mirrored space was a reflection of that, but the real world continued beyond any such parameters. Sela was detained for questioning, nonchalantly holding up her mirror.

I would not need to do anything to grant that portion of the wish.  However, prosperity was another matter.  I could have channeled the undercurrents to make that happen, but not without cost.
