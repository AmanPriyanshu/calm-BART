Your mother kindly takes you to bed in your bed zzz zzz You awake in an unfamiliar place, and a tall bearded man in a robe is before you. You can't really make out his face-But you really like his beard-He speaks and says "You sir, have come of age and now need to learn the sacred art of being a kazoo master. A prophecy has predicted that you'll be a pretty cool dude one day and your training will begin now. Now navigate the tunnel maze." And then the man threw down some pellet that released smoke onto the ground, started coughing muttered something or other about his lungs being infernal contraptions and then disappeared with the smoke.
