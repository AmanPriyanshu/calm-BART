You scan a few of the passages. A picture of a dog, which looks very much like the guard dog you encountered earlier, is accompanied by a caption: Years ago, herders used the Blottnian Moose Dog to help control their herds.  Centuries of careful breeding have made the Moose Dog extremely intelligent and hard-working.  Today, the same herding instinct that once served moose herders now serves Blottnian government security police, who use the Moose Dog to help control the cheerful citizens. Blottnya even trains Moose Dogs for service abroad; guard dogs are the country's second largest export. Teeterwaller reads the book over your shoulder.

Narrow passage The pipes are just barely far enough apart here for you to squeeze through to the northwest, but this is otherwise a dead end. A space between some pipes to the east affords a peephole view of a large courtyard. "Look!"  Mr. Teeterwaller says, pointing through the opening in the pipes. Through the opening, you can see several trucks parked in the courtyard--the same trucks that you saw hijacked. Two people, wearing baggy white whole-body suits with hoods and gas masks, emerge from the back of one of the trucks, walking backwards, carrying something.  They continue out down a ramp at the back of the truck; two more people dressed the same way come into view, also helping to carry the object, which you can now see is a large shiny silver crate.  Two more people come out of the truck, then another two carrying the trailing end of the crate.  The eight slowly make their way down the ramp with the obviously heavy cargo. You wonder what they could be removing from the trucks that requires such elaborate protective clothing.  You look at Teeterwaller.  He's watching intently, but, strangely, does not seem surprised by what he's seeing. Another space-suited worker emerges from the truck, slowly waving a wand attached by a cord to a box that makes intermittent ticking sounds. You feel a chill as you realize that the cargo must be radioactive. The group and their load disappear behind the truck, and the clicking of the Geiger counter recedes into inaudibility. Teeterwaller continues watching for a few moments.  "Interesting," he finally says. [ACTION] look

"I'll wait here until you reach the bottom, to make sure we don't put too much weight on the hose." Slowly, you maneuver yourself over to the edge nearest the opening, and lean out of the cage, holding on to the pole with both hands.  It's only a foot or two to the hose, but somehow it feels like you're about to try jumping over a canyon. You realize you've been holding your breath, and force yourself to exhale.  You jerk one hand out and grab at the hose, slipping at first but finally getting a good grip on it.  You carefully swing one leg out onto the framework supporting the windows, then the other, taking care not to put any weight on the glass. With nothing left to do, you let go of the cage with your other hand and grab at the hose.  The framework is obviously sturdy enough to support you if it can support all of this glass, you keep telling yourself, but you can feel it flexing under you. Having successfully negotiated the chasm between the cage and the hose, you feel much less panicked, and start descending the hose.  It's a nice rough material and easy to grip as you climb down. The descent takes less time than you would have thought, given the amount of hose you had to feed down through the hatch.  You reach the floor, and rest a moment to let the adrenaline wear off. Atrium The polished marble walls of this vast chamber slant slightly inward as they rise hundreds of feet to the glass panes of the ceiling. Lights from the towers above the surface twinkle like Christmas tree decorations through the glass.  An elevator is to the west, and passages lead north and southeast.

The spark fades, and the disk glows with an intense but ghostly blue light. You suddenly feel like you're tumbling sideways, and it feels like something is pulling your feet and your head in opposite directions. You reach out for something to hold, but find nothing in reach. Just as you think you're going to hit the ground, you realize that the floor is twenty feet away and getting further.  You're falling, but somehow you're falling toward the ceiling.  The room is spinning rapidly, and you see that Mr. Teeterwaller is falling alongside you, his eyes closed and his arms flailing wildly; beside him the brightly-glowing disk is serenly floating in mid-air. You keep falling upwards for several seconds, moving directly toward a large air vent on the ceiling.  You draw closer and closer to the vent, and you brace yourself for impact.  In a moment the vent is only a few feet away, but now you can see that you're not moving very quickly after all, and you easily maneuver yourself into the opening. Teeterwaller crashes into the ceiling just outside the vent, but you manage to grab his arm and help him through the opening. You find yourself in a large air duct.  The disk floats up through the opening; its glow gradually fades, and as it does, you, Teeterwaller, and the disk settle to the floor of the duct.  Gravity returns to normal. Air duct This aluminum air duct is just large enough to crawl through here, but splits into several smaller ducts to the west, none of which are large enough to permit further passage.  The duct widens to the east. In the floor is a square opening, two feet on a side, whose cover has been swung out and down; a cavernous chamber below is visible through the opening. You see a black disk here. Through the opening, you see the door to the lab slide open, and dozens of guards rush into the lab, looking up at you from the floor far below.

"`Rightfully and morally' yours," he scoffs.  "You're just as bad as the government, hiding this technology for decades.  You're worse, in fact, the way you dole it out a little at a time to maximize your profit at everyone else's expense." The gray-haired man shakes his head slightly.  "Profit isn't our motive," he says.  "It is society's readiness to absorb change that dictates the rate of our disclosures.  If we were to reveal all we knew at one time, the world would plunge into chaos." "You'll never get away with this," Teeterwaller says.  "You actually think the government won't figure out who stole the artifacts?" "The government will never even suspect they were taken," the gray-haired man responds dismissively.  "We replaced the originals with inert duplicates.  The fools have never been able to learn anything from the originals anyway; they'll labor for fifty more fruitless years, then shrug, pack the whole mess off to a warehouse in Illinois, and move on to their next assignments." Thunder rumbles from the sky overhead. [ACTION] wait

[STATE] Time passes... The gray-haired man looks at you expectantly. Static electricity crackles through the sky overhead. [ACTION] throw disk [STATE] You throw the disk.  Teeterwaller and the gray-haired man follow the disk with their eyes as it arcs into the night sky and disappears into the distance. "I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement," the gray-haired man says.  He motions to the guards, who come up onto the roof and arrest you. The guards take you to their security office, and later turn you over to the local police, who arrest you on trespassing charges.  You and Teeterwaller tell your fantastic story of hijacked trucks and floating anti-gravity disks, but the police just ignore you. After a night in the local jail, the police release you, explaining that the company that owns the plant is not pressing charges.  In town, you and Teeterwaller find a mechanic to fix the car.  You return home, having missed your meeting.  Life returns to normal. In the months that follow, the subject of that strange night seems to become taboo, and you and Teeterwaller never again discuss it. Eventually, Teeterwaller leaves the company; you hear later that he's working for one of those UFO magazines, writing bitter diatribes about government conspiracies and military cover-ups. You often wonder what might have happened if you had escaped with the odd little black disk, but you feel fortunate enough to have made it through the experience unscathed. *** Your life has returned to normal. *** Your score is 85 of a possible 100, in 748 moves.  If Mr. Teeterwaller were to evaluate your performance thus far, he would rank you as the next junior executive.

[ACTION] give disk to man [STATE] "Thank you," he says, taking the disk.  He shakes your hand, "Welcome aboard, Mr. Vice President," he says, then turns to Teeterwaller and welcomes him. As promised, you are immediately appointed a Vice President at AmCaustiCo, a maker of caustic chemical speciality products, and given a plush corner office overlooking a pleasant little woods a safe distance from the smoke-belching factories whose maintenance schedule you are assigned to oversee. You find your compensation much more than comfortable and your duties agreeably undemanding, leaving you plenty of time to practice your golf and "network" with other top executives at the country club, trading stock tips and dirty jokes.  Years later, looking back, you know you made a good career decision that strange night, but you can't help wondering from time to time what might have happened if you'd somehow escaped with the odd little black disk.  It's an idle thought, though; you'd just have ended up like Teeterwaller, writing bitter diatribes for some little conspiracy-minded UFO magazine. *** You have a pleasant but vaguely unsatisfying career. *** Your score is 90 of a possible 100, in 748 moves.

[STATE] Time passes... The gray-haired man looks at you expectantly. Thunder roars overhead.  Lightning flashes from cloud to cloud in the sky above you.  Suddenly, a tongue of lightning cuts through the air directly in front of you, striking the center of the dome. Somehow, the lightning bolt stays where it is, dancing a little around the top of the dome but continuing to discharge electricity. [ACTION] put disk in lightning [STATE] You carefully hold out the disk, and very slowly move your hand toward the lightning bolt.  Your skin tingles with electricity as you get closer, and your hair starts to stand on end. A tiny tendril of brilliant white light leaps out from the lightning bolt and touches the disk.  You feel a jab and jerk your hand back, but you see that the disk is glowing with an intense blue light, and you start to feel light-headed and disoriented.  Teeterwaller grabs your arm, and the two of you rapidly ascend into the sky.  The gray haired man reaches his hand out toward you and shouts something, but you're already too far away to hear what he's saying. The wind picks up speed and changes direction several times as you climb, and you start drifting to the north.  Soon the lights of the plant are behind you, and you're over open ground.  Silence falls as your own motion matches the wind speed and you move along at the same rate as the surrounding air. "I can't believe we made it out of there alive!"  Teeterwaller says. "This is an amazing find," he says, indicating the disk. You start descending again, and you see that you're headed for the road--in fact, you can see Teeterwaller's car, right where you left it. The disk's glow fades, and you settle gently to the ground near the car. Headlights approach from down the road.  They draw nearer, and the vehicle starts slowing down and pulling over behind Teeterwaller's car. You almost make a run for it, when you see that the vehicle is a van from a local television station.  A young woman in a smart blue dress gets out from the passenger side, and a man in a flannel shirt carrying a video camera follows. "Excuse me," the woman says as she approaches you.  "We've had some reports of strange electrical activity in the sky around here, and I wondered if either of you have seen anything interesting tonight." Teeterwaller smiles at you.  "Yes," he says.  "As a matter of fact we have." *** You have made history. *** Your score is 100 of a possible 100, in 750 moves.
