I'd just like to warn you first that my methods of studying Latin are not what you would call normal. But I at least would call them effective, and that's what counts in the end. Now, to get started, let's imagine you are a wolf living in Siberia... Please press SPACE to continue. And that would be enough solid travel for tonight. You still have the energy to get a drink and a bite to eat around here, though, so it isn't yet time for sleep. Near the Fallen Pine The key landmark of this area is a pine whose span is decidedly more horizontal than those that surround it. No creatures have been around here: the only tracks are your own pawprints. You could go in any direction from here, but in terms of what is actually interesting you smell a stream not far to the east. Snowish precipitation is slowly falling from the night sky.

You remember the summer day that The Tide came very well: first the flood reports, then the reports of walking black cephalopod creatures laying waste to all in their path, then the redundant confirmation that said creatures weren't really cephalopods. And now, five months later, the naval powers of the world are down for the count, the coasts of the Americas and Europe are miles inland from where they used to be, and the showdown of the underdog militias versus the alien invaders is simply not going the way it does in the movies. There's really only one hope that remains: communication. From their strategic groupings to the biological weapons they use with their tentacles, it's clear that the creatures are intelligent. But, despite all the work you've been involved with, there hasn't been the slightest improvement in bridging the gap. Now, however, a dispatch has informed you that you were selected to join a secret government project that has been said to be the best hope yet. The details weren't given out, but, now that you are in the facility, you will soon be familiarized with the new plan. You've wanted to communicate across species as long as you can remember, and now you may just get your chance.

You remember the summer day that The Tide came very well: first the flood reports, then the reports of walking black cephalopod creatures laying waste to all in their path, then the redundant confirmation that said creatures weren't really cephalopods. And now, five months later, the naval powers of the world are down for the count, the coasts of the Americas and Europe are miles inland from where they used to be, and the showdown of the underdog militias versus the alien invaders is simply not going the way it does in the movies. There's really only one hope that remains: communication. From their strategic groupings to the biological weapons they use with their tentacles, it's clear that the creatures are intelligent. But, despite all the work you've been involved with, there hasn't been the slightest improvement in bridging the gap. Now, however, a dispatch has informed you that you were selected to join a secret government project that has been said to be the best hope yet. The details weren't given out, but, now that you are in the facility, you will soon be familiarized with the new plan. You've wanted to communicate across species as long as you can remember, and now you may just get your chance.

I was focused enough on the report that I suddenly started calling that as-of-yet-unnamed scientist in that as-of-yet-unnamed story I was making "Dr. Clark." Then, in late April 2010, I had a bizarre dream that gave me Dr. Clark's first name: the unusual name of Huncel (Hon-cell, with hon as in honey). I believe I came up with the name of Beyond Division at about the same time. [ACTION] west
[STATE]  FOOTNOTE 4 Back in November 2009 in Social Studies everyone in my class did a report on an important figure in early 19th century American history. We all found a quote and made a trinket concerning our chosen person. I ended up doing a report on William Clark, with his legendary misspelled journal entry "Ocian in view! O! The Joy!" and a simple cardboard telescope. I was focused enough on the report that I suddenly started calling that as-of-yet-unnamed scientist in that as-of-yet-unnamed story I was making "Dr. Clark." Then, in late April 2010, I had a bizarre dream that gave me Dr. Clark's first name: the unusual name of Huncel (Hon-cell, with hon as in honey). I believe I came up with the name of Beyond Division at about the same time. [ACTION] west [STATE] Topics: straight and treats > W Main Room The first thing you notice is a lack of any temporary features in the room this time: all that is here is the usual canine accoutrements and human furniture. The sleeping cell is east and the rest of this place is to the north. Huncel takes a seat on the recliner and gestures you to get on the rug below it if you want. "So, in lieu of what we normally do, how about we talk a bit? I believe at this point you are more willing than previously to just talk about you and your feelings." Query as to whether this will still lead to treats, or jump straight in? [ACTION] sit on rug

"Yes, this counts as an experiment. And the first part of the test was whether you'd question the possibility of treats due to the significant change. Good job, you've earned an extra eventual treat!" Huncel sends you a weird vision, and then, detecting your lack of understanding, assures you that it is supposed to represent a human smiling. "So, Ambassador, are you content at this moment?" Lament the lack of opportunities to tear The Tide up, or lament the lack of a mate? It feels like Huncel is hinting something more around the food end of things, though. [ACTION] opportunities

[ACTION] opportunities [STATE] Topics: interloping, injured, and damage > OPPORTUNITIES You send all the messages you can that imply that you'd want to spend the rest of your life at war with The Tide, but Huncel sends exasperation and his emotional memories of the glass incident: how he was worried he couldn't control and that you would endanger everyone in the facility including yourself, plus the paternal feelings he's trying and failing to hide. Seems Huncel will never give that up. "That does bring us elsewhere though. We humans often ask why. Why is the sky blue, why do you have your abilities, why do we do what we do? So I ask you: why do you hate The Tide the way do you?" Well, Huncel hates The Tide because of its damage to humanity, and The Tide injured you. What reason do you need though? The Tide is an interloping force. [ACTION] injured

Maybe you don't know it yourself, but something unprecedented must have happened to you. In the entire history of humanity there is not one case of a wolf or anything at all with telepathy like yours, and other animals pretty much never get that angry at the species of something that attacked them." The back of your mind screams at a possible reason for it all, but you just can't bring it up into something concrete. "Well, I know you're against The Tide and all, but aren't you happy that you don't have to hunt anymore? This would be a paradise for you if your motivations were that of a typical wolf." [ACTION] no
