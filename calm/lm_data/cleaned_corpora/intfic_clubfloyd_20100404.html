[STATE] The last reports are about civil disturbances breaking out all over the planet. The populace started blaming science and technology for the catastrophe; centres of knowledge and learning were attacked and destroyed. Law and order had suffered a complete breakdown and the very last story is about a force of the local volunteer army being sent to 'restore' order at the temple. For a long time you can do nothing; you just stand unable to take it all in. How could this have happened? What could have gone wrong with the test? Well, the answer must lie in the test chamber under the research and development building.

It is the day of the test and you can see yourself being strapped into the chair in the test chamber. Colin gives you a thumbs up from the Control Room and the ignition lights come on; the test begins. You can tell immediately that something is wrong, the technicians in the control room look worried. The beam which was locked onto Alpha City on the Europa Continent (the other side of the planet) has moved, but they cannot tell where. The system starts to draw more and more power as it automatically tries to lock on. Colin can be heard saying, "I think he has particled but we are not getting a confirmation signal. We must try to get him back." Someone off camera says, "I can't get the beam to lock, we can't get him back." Out loud you say, "Some how it threw me into the future, so no wonder they could not lock on. That is why I'm still in the chair, the system does not know that I arrived."  As a safety measure, if no confirmation is received, the system holds onto the person assuming they have not been particled. [Press ENTER to continue] Your attention is drawn back to the screen. Suddenly warning signals start to flash and it appears that the technicians are losing control of the beam. You hear one of them say, "We are losing confinement. My God! It is starting to scatter! Shut off the power! Shut off the power!" With no warning Colin and all the other technicians vanish. You shudder as if someone has just worked over your grave. With the system drawing that much power as they tried in vain to lock on the beam; if that beam scattered what would happen when it came into contact with people? You now have a very good idea of what has happened to the population of the planet; they have been particled into the past, the future, who knows. More importantly, the test is still running. [Press ENTER to continue] Over the next hour you watch the whole of the data-disc, several times. You now know that the staff at the testing centre tried, in vain, to shutdown the system. The very safety measures designed to protect had destroyed. The automatic systems would not let the test be stopped because it was still particling the test subject, i.e. you. With the test still running and the beam scattered over the planet any person it came into contact with would be beamed away. You have a working theory that the reason you are unaffected is that you are still 'technically' being particled. It is now very clear that you need to shutdown the test. You have no idea what this will do to you, both the one in the chair and this version of you, but the test must be stopped. You need to find a way of shutting off the power.

[STATE] You put the data-disc onto the view screen. You take the data-disc from the view screen. [put a data-disc in slot] You insert the data-disc into the viewer, after a few seconds it begins to work. It is the day of the test and you can see yourself being strapped into the chair in the test chamber. Colin gives you a thumbs up from the Control Room and the ignition lights come on; the test begins. You can tell immediately that something is wrong, the technicians in the control room look worried. The beam which was locked onto Alpha City on the Europa Continent (the other side of the planet) has moved, but they cannot tell where. The system starts to draw more and more power as it automatically tries to lock on. Colin can be heard saying, "I think he has particled but we are not getting a confirmation signal. We must try to get him back." Someone off camera says, "I can't get the beam to lock, we can't get him back." Out loud you say, "Some how it threw me into the future, so no wonder they could not lock on. That is why I'm still in the chair, the system does not know that I arrived."  As a safety measure, if no confirmation is received, the system holds onto the person assuming they have not been particled. [Press ENTER to continue] Your attention is drawn back to the screen. Suddenly warning signals start to flash and it appears that the technicians are losing control of the beam. You hear one of them say, "We are losing confinement. My God! It is starting to scatter! Shut off the power! Shut off the power!" With no warning Colin and all the other technicians vanish. You shudder as if someone has just worked over your grave. With the system drawing that much power as they tried in vain to lock on the beam; if that beam scattered what would happen when it came into contact with people? You now have a very good idea of what has happened to the population of the planet; they have been particled into the past, the future, who knows. More importantly, the test is still running. [Press ENTER to continue] Over the next hour you watch the whole of the data-disc, several times. You now know that the staff at the testing centre tried, in vain, to shutdown the system. The very safety measures designed to protect had destroyed. The automatic systems would not let the test be stopped because it was still particling the test subject, i.e. you. With the test still running and the beam scattered over the planet any person it came into contact with would be beamed away. You have a working theory that the reason you are unaffected is that you are still 'technically' being particled. It is now very clear that you need to shutdown the test. You have no idea what this will do to you, both the one in the chair and this version of you, but the test must be stopped. You need to find a way of shutting off the power.
