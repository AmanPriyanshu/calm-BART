[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. Adventurer's Consumer Guide You are a product tester for the Adventurer's Consumer Guide, a magazine that reviews all sorts of equipment an adventurer might need for his adventures. Your magazine is highly respected because of the thorough tests you put the equipment through. The tests aren't just done at the magazine's offices. No, the product testers go on actual adventures to test the equipment out in the field. Sometimes you kill an evil overlord; sometimes you rescue a fair maiden. Most of the time, like today, you just go out looking for a treasure in Treasure Cave Mountain, a perfect place for adventures as it contains plenty of caves, treasures, monsters and traps. As you are putting on the soon-to-be-tested magical coat, magical ring and magical helmet, your editor says, "On this mission you'll be having a helper with you." "Really?" you say. You usually work alone. "Yeah, but it's part of a test. See, there's this new agency that is renting out sidekicks. We are going to write a review about it. Oh, here he is now." Into your office walks a goblin: a green humanoid creature with pointy ears, about a meter tall. "Hi, you must be my new boss," he says to you. "I guess I am. What is it you're supposed to do, exactly?" "Well, I'm very brave and helpful, plus I'm a ferocious killing machine. If you see any kind of monster, or anything at all, and you want it killed, just tell me, and it's toast." "Okay... well, I think we should get going." You and your new companion are off to Treasure Cave Mountain. Your mission is to return with one really big treasure. Any really big treasure. If you are unfamiliar with interactive fiction, type HELP. If you care, type CREDITS. In this game you can't examine things. Instead use either "look" to see descriptions of the things in the room you are in, or "inventory" to see descriptions of what you are carrying. You also can't use "look inside", "look under", "look behind", "look <direction>" or "search". But you can use "read". To see your inventory without the long descriptions of all you are carrying, type: "inventory short". Or simply: "i s". Or simply: "is". No time passes when you use "look" or "inventory". You communicate by "talk to [whatever]", or by giving commands in this format: "goblin, give me the cow-o-meter". It is possible to put this game in an unwinnable state, but you should be able to figure out when this has happened. Should you wish to re-read the above information during the game, type ABOUT.

You hear a calm pleasant female voice in your head: "It wouldn't be very heroic to ask somebody else to do your fighting for you." [ACTION] inventory [STATE] The new magical sword from Adventurer's Emporium. According to the commercial it will start to vibrate when you are close to danger. A mail-ordered short metal staff with a clear orb on the end. Its manufacturers say the staff will remove any creature that comes in contact with the orb. Inside the orb you can see a small unmoving cluster of turquoise tentacles. A Remmingheim Supreme crossbow, loaded with an arrow. The Supreme model is supposed to have a special feature. When you shoot it, the arrow will magically return, and the crossbow will be loaded again. The hard, razor-sharp arrow is protruding a good ten centimeters from the front of the crossbow. "The Ultimate Creature Manual" by Arthur Hippoman. According to the back it contains information about every single monster in the world, and how to defend yourself against them. It is suspiciously thin. A small cage. It is closed and locked with a code-lock (You know the code.). A gremlin, a small green humanoid creature with pointy ears, is trapped inside. He is wearing a tiny ring. He is smoking a tiny cigarette. His thin arms are sticking through the bars of the cage, and he is fiddling with the code-lock, trying one combination at a time. You are wearing: A Hustlespleen & Poe Coat of Invisibility, though at the moment it looks like an ordinary, long, brown, coat. It is supposed to turn invisible (or turn visible again) whenever you say the magic word "tango". A Super Champion Helmet fastened with a strap under your chin. It is round and made of thin metal. It is supposed to magically turn you into a hero. On your finger is a Snuffelburg & Co. Type F Magical Ring. It is red and golden. It is supposed to protect you from any magical rays, by moving the effect of the ray away from you and onto the gremlin, which is wearing a smaller, magically connected, ring. A pair of red boxer shorts, decorated with tiny teddy-bears dressed as sailors. They are not something you are supposed to test; they are your own. On a mountain ledge A narrow mountain ledge leading west (where you came from) and east. To the north is a tall mountain wall and to the south a long drop.

He is sitting in the lotus position, his head is turned towards the statue, and his eyes are closed. He is wearing a white loincloth.

This particular teleporter seems badly designed though: the lever is far away from it, almost on the other side of the cave. Up from the lever sticks the new magical sword from Adventurer's Emporium. According to the commercial it will start to vibrate when you are close to danger. It is shaking like crazy, but not enough to shake the lever. You can see the goblin sidekick and a cage here. The sword goes even crazier and starts thrashing like a headless chicken on drugs. The sword makes the lever shake. There comes a low humming sound from the teleporter.

When you shoot it, the arrow will magically return, and the crossbow will be loaded again. The hard, razor-sharp arrow is protruding a good ten centimeters from the front of the crossbow. "The Ultimate Creature Manual" by Arthur Hippoman. According to the back it contains information about every single monster in the world, and how to defend yourself against them. It is suspiciously thin. A Super Champion Helmet. It is round and made of thin metal. It was supposed to magically turn you into a hero. You are wearing: A pair of mirrorshades. You could see yourself in them if you weren't wearing them. On your finger is a Snuffelburg & Co. Type F Magical Ring. It is red and golden.

A burly barbarian is leaning against a wall, his arms crossed over his naked chest, a grim expression on his face. A long sabre is in his belt. A tough-looking dwarf, wearing chain mail and a helmet, is sitting on the floor. He is holding an axe almost as big as himself. He is smoking a pipe. A muscular white horse and a mangy donkey stand here. The goblin comes running after you. [ACTION] north [STATE] Gigantic cave An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the north. There is also an exit to the south. A red automat, hundred of meters tall, stands in the middle of the cave. Despite the insane magnitude of the machine, its money-slot and buttons are normal-sized and placed at normal height. The merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something is written on the automat next to the buttons. A stone altar stands up against a wall. It is low, shadowy, bloodstained and has runes written on it. Next to it is a huge pile of fish bones. On the altar you can see: A sluggish fish. Its eyes are white and have no pupils. It is crawling around. The goblin comes running after you. [ACTION] north

[STATE] Big cave This cave has an exit southeast to the outside, or you could go further into the mountain to the northwest. A somewhat larger than life-size statue of his holiness One-Hand Jack stands in the middle of the cave. Jack used to be an infamous pirate, but later formed Hoverism, a peaceful religion. The statue holds its left arm out and up, the hook at the end of it just low enough to be reached. The statue's head is gone. The Hoverist is hovering about a meter above the floor, cursing and trying to clean himself from the turquoise sludge that covers his body. Several fragments from the safe are lying here. Quite a lot of turquoise sludge is on the floor; most of it round the northwest exit. Though you cannot see it, you know that a Hustlespleen & Poe Coat of Invisibility hangs on the hook. It is supposed to turn visible (or turn invisible again) whenever you say the magic word "tango". A mail-ordered short metal staff with a clear orb on the end lies here. It has lots of turquoise sludge on it. Its manufacturers say the staff will remove any creature that comes in contact with the orb. Inside the orb you can see the goblin sidekick.

[ACTION] northeast [STATE] Vast cave This cave has an exit leading outside to the southwest. In the middle of the ceiling, high above you, is a round hole. On the floor, directly under the hole, is a pile of hay. A short lever with a handle sticks out from a wall. The handle has a thin, wide gap, large enough for the fingers of one hand to go through. A metallic pyramid, about half a meter high, sticks up from the cave floor. You once tested a hundred different teleporters, and you recognize the pyramid as one of the safest and least complicated models. To use it you just stand on it and shake the lever repeatedly.

A hippoman, half man, half hippo, stands knitting something yellow. He is fat, purple and has two very thick legs. He is wearing your helmet. A young angry-looking woman stands holding a large placard saying "Save the braineating parasite worm!" She is clearly one of those monster rights activists that have been making your job so much harder lately. The gremlin has climbed quite high up on the wall. He is a small green humanoid creature with pointy ears. He is wearing a tiny ring and is smoking a tiny cigarette. A carrot with tiny wings flies around. Its arms and legs look like those of a human, only much smaller. It has no head or face. A steady shower of shimmering sparks falls from all over its body; each spark disappears before hitting the ground. A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is open and empty. A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very complex. Actually it is very easy to use. You know this because on a previous product-testing mission you came across a machine just like it and spend four hours trying to figure out how it worked. The machine is for sharpening tools and weapons. Just put what you want sharpened into it and wait. You can see a big tacky holy grail here. More blood erupts from your head.

[STATE] Tremendous Cave An extremely bright light comes from this cave's only exit to the south. Some runes are written on the wall. A hippoman, half man, half hippo, stands knitting something yellow. He is fat, purple and has two very thick legs. He is wearing your helmet. A young angry-looking woman stands holding a large placard saying "Save the braineating parasite worm!" She is clearly one of those monster rights activists that have been making your job so much harder lately. The gremlin has climbed quite high up on the wall. He is a small green humanoid creature with pointy ears. He is wearing a tiny ring and is smoking a tiny cigarette. A carrot with tiny wings flies around. Its arms and legs look like those of a human, only much smaller. It has no head or face. A steady shower of shimmering sparks falls from all over its body; each spark disappears before hitting the ground. A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is open and empty. A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very complex. Actually it is very easy to use. You know this because on a previous product-testing mission you came across a machine just like it and spend four hours trying to figure out how it worked. The machine is for sharpening tools and weapons. Just put what you want sharpened into it and wait. There is quite a lot of blood here. A severed finger lies here. On it is a Snuffelburg & Co.

On the table stands a shimmering pink translucent cube and a small, rusty, holy grail. A small round stage stands close to the table. It is apparently made from human faces frozen in terrible screams. A small flamingo-headed man sits behind the table in a comfortable-looking armchair covered in obviously fake giraffe fur. He is wearing a jester's suit, including a ridiculous hat with bells on. He is staring at the pink cube. An armadillo-headed woman in a white toga sits next to him on a barstool made from green shimmering flames. She is reading a huge black book called "Quantum Physics in Infinitely Dimensional Realities".

He is wearing a jester's suit, including a ridiculous hat with bells on. He is staring at the pink cube. An armadillo-headed woman in a white toga sits next to him on a barstool made from green shimmering flames. She is reading a small orange book called "The Myth of Economics". A big pile of ashes lies next to her. [ACTION] give book to woman [STATE] (the Beyond the Meaning of Life to the armadillo-headed woman) The armadillo-headed woman takes the book and starts reading.

The author says the existence of gods is logically impossible. Ha!" She quickly reads through about twenty more pages and wrinkles her brow. "His arguments are pretty good though. Surely there must be a flaw in his logic somewhere?" She quickly reads through the rest of the book. "Nope, there wasn't." With a loud pop she disappears. Shortly afterwards the flames in her barstool die down. There is a flickering image inside the cube. The flamingo-headed man giggles and says, "Some woman in Brazil just stepped on a beehive."

On the way you get caught up in a hurricane, attacked by a flock of ducks, and hit by lightning. The lightning causes you to drop the staff, and it falls into a lake.

The trip takes a day and a night. On the way you get caught up in a hurricane, attacked by a flock of ducks, and hit by lightning.

[ACTION] stand on teleporter [STATE] You get on the teleporter. The sword makes the lever shake. The teleporter starts shaking and smoking. The cave begins to fade out around you, and another cave fades in. Voluminous cave This cave has an exit to the east. In the middle of the floor is a round hole. A huge monster skeleton lies here, with an elf skeleton in its mouth. The goblin begins to fade in next to you. You look down at yourself. You seem unsubstantial, like a ghost. Slowly you begin to take on a more solid form. Now you look normal. [ACTION] northwest

A goblin woman is standing here. She is wearing a medallion, winter boots, a long fur coat and a round fur hat. She is carrying a purse. You are not quite sure, but with her long ears, sharp yellow teeth, and big feet you think she is pretty cute by goblin standards. She is holding your magical crossbow. The goblin comes running after you. "Well, hello there!" says the female goblin and smiles. "Uh, hi," says the goblin, his cheeks turning a darker shade of green. They seem distracted. [ACTION] west

[STATE] "After you boss." [ACTION] enter hole [STATE] You jump down the hole. You land in a pile of hay. You hear someone shouting, "Wheeeeeee!" and you look up. The goblin is falling right towards you. You quickly roll to the side, and the goblin lands in the hay. You two get up. Vast cave This cave has an exit leading outside to the southwest. In the middle of the ceiling, high above you, is a round hole. On the floor, directly under the hole, is a pile of hay. A short lever with a handle sticks out from a wall. The handle has a thin, wide gap, large enough for the fingers of one hand to go through. A metallic pyramid, about half a meter high, sticks up from the cave floor. You once tested a hundred different teleporters, and you recognize the pyramid as one of the safest and least complicated models. To use it you just stand on it and shake the lever repeatedly. This particular teleporter seems badly designed though: the lever is far away from it, almost on the other side of the cave. Up from the lever sticks the new magical sword from Adventurer's Emporium. According to the commercial it will start to vibrate when you are close to danger. It is shaking like crazy, but not enough to shake the lever. You can see the goblin sidekick and a cage here. The sword goes even crazier and starts thrashing like a headless chicken on drugs. The sword makes the lever shake. There comes a low humming sound from the teleporter. [ACTION] southwest

The goblin comes running after you. [ACTION] northwest [STATE] Big cave This cave has an exit southeast to the outside, or you could go further into the mountain to the northwest. A somewhat larger than life-size statue of his holiness One-Hand Jack stands in the middle of the cave. Jack used to be an infamous pirate, but later formed Hoverism, a peaceful religion. The statue holds its left arm out and up, the hook at the end of it just low enough to be reached. The statue's head is gone. An old Hoverist is hovering about a meter above the floor. He is sitting in the lotus position, his head is turned towards the statue, and his eyes are closed. He is wearing a white loincloth. Somebody has hung some Christmas ornaments on him. Several fragments from the safe are lying here. Though you cannot see it, you know that a Hustlespleen & Poe Coat of Invisibility hangs on the hook. It is supposed to turn visible (or turn invisible again) whenever you say the magic word "tango". The goblin comes running after you. [ACTION] take ornaments
