Its branches are hung with ripe red apples. Scattered flowers wink at you from the grass, as the sun shines brightly overhead.  A babbling brook softly runs westwards.  A small foot-bridge allows you to cross from one bank to the other. A robin is perched atop the tree, whistling a merry tune. It's an old, gnarled apple tree.  As you stare at it, you think you can see vague outlines of a grumpy-looking face in the trunk.  Juicy, delicious-looking red apples hang from the branches above your head, and the tree looks great for climbing.  A colorful kite-like object is sitting on a branch, high up in the tree. You approach the tree and start to climb it.  You are startled by a sudden voice which seems to emanate from the tree itself, like some mystic speech from the kingdom of faerie.

It is flat, but then mounted atop the flat part is an extra structure which appears to be a long thin wall cutting straight across the roof.  The wall is shaped like a right triangle, with the square corner and one other affixed to the gazebo, and the third jutting straight up.

The designs appear to be letters.  Words, even.  You can make out only a single word this time: "Phoenix".  Hanging in the web, you see a small fly. Zippy whines quietly.  He trots a short distance, then comes back to sit at your feet again. [ACTION] take fly [STATE] Taken. Zippy barks shrilly, and then looks at you.  His eyes are wide and a little panicky.

[ACTION] east [STATE] ventually the mushroom patch ends, and the river widens. The figment of you walks along beside you, his footsteps making no sound. Zippy trots along by your side. By a wide stream This is a clearing in the middle of a forest.  Tall trees grow all around, moss hangs from their branches, and there are scattered flowers.  A stream runs through the forest here.  It is wide but shallow, allowing you to see the granite ground below it.  Small bits of quartz are embedded everywhere in the granite, and they sparkle and glimmer as the sunlight shines on the moving water.  Strange glowing fish are swimming around quite happily in the water.  Many are swimming against the current, seemingly without effort.  The stream passes into the forest to the east, and is quickly lost amongst the trees. You, or a long-lost twin at least, are standing here. Zippy, your pet dog, is scampering around here. Your great-aunt Polly is here, her eyes twinkling merrily at you. Zippy glances at the water, and then begins to bark loudly at the lightfish for a few minutes.  He turns and looks at you expectantly. "Hello, boy," great-aunt Polly says.  "Never expected to see me again, did you?  I see you've turned into a grown man already.  Well, well.  I only wish I was alive to see it."  She sighs. [ACTION] examine fish

In any case, they swim around and around in complex patterns as you watch.  It's almost as if they're trying to tell you something. "Still, this isn't so bad.  Daniel brought me back to talk to you.

Raphael cast mountains against the invaders, rended their ships in twain with bare hands, struck missiles from their paths, before being crushed to earth by a great cannon-blast from the main ship.  Lilith sent the rivers out to battle, great tsunamis to knock ships from the air and blind their gunners, until she too was laid low by the enemy. Jaela Storm-lord, strongest of the three, sent lighting and thunder and tornados to rage against them, and finally forced them to flee.

[ACTION] examine father [STATE] Yes, it's your father.  The man that left you when you were only six years old, leaving nothing but memories behind.  He never, ever even bothered to call, even on your birthdays.  Your mother never talked about him much, but when you got older, you realized his departure was probably responsible for her drinking problem, at the very least. Bastard. The years seemed to have aged him deeper than they should have, but of course it's hard to tell.  His eyes are still the same burning blue that you remember from long-ago dreams. "Hello, son."  Your eyes open wide as you seen the man. "D-D-Dad?  Is that you?" Your father nods, slowly.  "Yeah, it's me."  He looks at you. "You've grown up." Anger returns, almost involuntarily, as he speaks.  "Yes, I have. But you wouldn't know, would you?  You never came to see me."  Your voice is already trembling. He looks pained, and suddenly shivers.  He starts to speak, stops, and starts again.  "I, I, I can't say much except ...  'sorry'?" You interrupt his next words with a shout.  "Sorry?  Sorry???  You bastard, you left me alone, left Mom to drown her sorrows with all her fucking six-packs, and all you can say is 'sorry'??" Your father seems staggered by the outburst.  Each word strikes him like a blow.  "I *am* sorry, so very very sorry.  I just couldn't handle it.  Having a child, losing my job ...  I stuck it out as long as I could, and then I ran.  Left one night, walked out the door, never came back ...  I'm sorry."  He seems close to tears. "Dammit, Dad, how could you do this?  Coward."  He shrinks away as you talk. You keep going, forcing him back.  "You left me.  You abandoned us.  You sent my life into a tailspin.  Me, the last hope for this crazy planet, me, the Phoenix, you ruined me.  You realize what you've done?" Your father stands up straight then, and looks at you for a long minute.  When he speaks, his voice is firm again, and clear.  "I'm sorry.  It was inexcusable.  I had no right to run.  But you don't either." "What?  What the hell are you talking about?  You're the problem here, not me." "Son, listen to me.  *Listen* to me.  When I ran, it was running away from myself.  You see ...  the Phoenix is carried by bloodlines. When I was young, I was Phoenix too." You are too shocked to speak, so he continues.  "Yeah, that's right. The Phoenix is genetic.  But it fades as you get older, passes along to the young and vigorous.  Your great-aunt had it too, though not as strong as I saw it in you.  Don't you see why I ran?  I knew what my childhood was like ...  things going wrong for me in school, at home, the accident that took both *my* parents away.  I couldn't bear it twice, to see it happen to my child as They tried to get him too.  I just couldn't.  So I ran away.  Maybe I hoped, even, to draw Them away from you.  I was just playing into Their hands, I realize now, but I was still pretty young then.  So I ran from you, ran from responsibility, ran from the Phoenix.  My gift never awakened.  I never flew.  You've got to fly now, son, because I never could." A quick pause, and he speaks again.  "I've been able to watch you a few times, as you grew up.  I saw you take the same paths I took, suffer the same things I did.  And I was never able to warn you.  It was agony.  Finally, They did get me after all -- a mistaken drive-by shooting, the police said -- and Daniel came to collect me.  *You* have got to break the pattern now.  Leave the cycle, and go fly free."  His voice stumbles to the end of the speech, and he takes a long shuddering breath.  "Break the cycle.  For me."  His hand stretches out to you. You slowly raise yours to meet his shadowy touch.  It is like touching air, almost, but not quite. "I forgive you, Dad."  The words bring sweet release as you say them, starting the healing of too many lost years. He smiles, the first smile of his you've seen since you were six. "Thanks." His hand reaches into his pocket, and he pulls something out. It drops onto the ground and rolls to your feet.  A bit of a grin comes to your father's face, and he says "Bust things wide open."  He looks at you for a long time, and then says one last word.  "Goodbye." Already, he is fading, and before the echo of the word has disappeared, he is no longer there.  Your father is gone, forever. "'Bye, Dad."  You speak to the empty air, then bend down to see what he left you. It seems to be one of the relics of the army stuff you remember he used to collect:  a hand grenade.

The flaming red light shoots from the hole, passing through the sphere.  It bends as it goes through the sphere, angling so that it flies upwards and strikes the large crystal in the ceiling.  Briefly, the large crystal shimmers with the color.  At the same time, it echoes the sound -- at a higher pitch. Unlike the other times, the music does not end here.  Rather, the tiny crystal on the gnomon vibrates, giving the sound a third time at an even higher pitch.  A pure white column of light flashes downwards, stretching from the crystal in the ceiling to the crystal on the gnomon.  And when the light strikes the tiny crystal, it splits into six parts, each one spreading outwards to touch a hole.  From the holes, six lines of color reach upwards to the ceiling crystal again, and again they form a single pure white column falling downwards.  The effect is that of a pillar of shining rainbow, with a heart of glowing white. Somehow, the sound reflects the visual, and the crystals are fairly purring with the growing tone.  The tone grows and grows and soon your whole body is humming with it, and the rainbow tower is shining forth into the darkness around it, and then there is a blinding/deafening explosion of noise and color. You blink your eyes and look around, pulling the sphere from the hole again. The round crystal has lost the internal sparks, and is a dull lusterless gray.  The other two crystals are nowhere to be seen. A sudden grating sound from above your head attracts your attention. Looking upwards, you can see that the ceiling is retracting -- warm sunlight floods into the room. The floor of the gazebo suddenly tilts slightly, and then tips back the other way. [ACTION] look

A muddy streak slashes through the field north-south, where the water used to be.  A wide white plank allows you to cross from one bank to the other.  Sticking out of the ground is a stone pillar, a control panel and joystick built into its side. You see a small fly, a grenade pin, an apple, and a thorny rake here. The gazebo continues to soar into the air.  When it finally stops, it is hanging about four meters off the ground, still with no apparent means of support.  The rope ladder dangles down from the entrance, just about brushing the grass.     Meanwhile, of course, the upward motion of the gazebo also affects its shadow, which is now such that the shadow of the gazebo falls between the second and third rocks. [ACTION] out

What the mirror actually does is reflect the one who views it, so isn't it far more truthful to have the mirror reflect ...  the past?  At least for this mirror, that seems to be true. Images begin to drift across the screen, like smoke rising from a fire, like clouds floating across the sky, like leaves riding a gentle stream-current. The first memories are pleasant.  You see your birthday party from age five, surrounded by both your parents and a circle of smiling friends .  .  . You see yourself, age six, with your dog Zippy, him barking madly and running in circles around tiny you as you throw sticks for him to fetch .  .  . There are other easy memories that come to mind, before the pictures turn darker. You see yourself cradling Zippy's broken and bloody body, crying into the dark night on an empty street .  .  . You see yourself, age seven, wailing because it is your birthday and your dad hasn't called for a year now .  .  . You see your mom staggering around the house, blind drunk, cursing and stumbling, and you hiding in the corner terrified .  .  . "These aren't *my* fault!"  you think, "The invaders, it's all their work.  How could they have ruined my life like this?  What did I do to deserve my shitty life?" Then that excuse is torn away as the pictures in the mirror shift again. Now you see yourself in high school, sitting at a desk.  Someone comes over to ask you a question and you turn your face away with a scowl. He retreats, a hurt expression on his face. And another scene, your senior year, someone asks you to the prom. Incredulous, you refuse, sure it's just a cruel joke.  Later, of course, you found out they had been deeply in love with you, but by then it was too late.  Too late .  .  . College, this time, and more of the same.  In all your classes, people try to reach out and are rebuffed.  You stagger through a year, and then another, spurning all attempts at friendship.  You flirt with alcohol and drugs for a while, finding solace there through a numbed mind, but eventually even those pale. You stare at each of the memories as they flow across the face of the mirror.  Each one pains you, and it is a dual pain:  pain from recalling the emotions, and the pain of realization, the pain as you see your mistakes for what they are.  More and more images go past, each one a scene from your life.  Finally, you see the thing that drove you to the cliff-top, that night in your dorm when you cried out that no one loved you, no one in the world. Perhaps for the same reasons and perhaps for others too, the scene brings you to tears one more time.  You lift your hand to your eye, and a single tear-drop tumbles down.  It glitters in a beam of sunlight as it falls oh-so-slowly, and splashes onto the mirror.  The mirror's surface ripples like water, and the pictures dissolve.  They are replaced by a black backdrop of star- spangled night, and Daniel's face. "Yes," says Daniel softly, "Yes.  You see it now.  Though you suffered in life, it was not all of others' doing.  You are ready for rebirth now, Phoenix. Fly."  He pauses for a minute and draws a shaky breath.  "You may turn the portal on now.  It is time for you to go home."  Daniel's image vanishes. Home?  It has been too long since the word meant anything to you. Still, he is right.  It is time to go home. [ACTION] examine mirror
