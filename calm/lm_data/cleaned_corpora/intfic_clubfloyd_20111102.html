Above you, the roar of overburdened engines grows nearer; with a tremendous crash, the Dragonfly lands, unharmed, in the middle of the safety net!  It worked! You're a hero! ...Or not.  You boss starts shaking you like a rag doll, yelling, "You idiot!  You moron!  Are you TRYING to kill us all?!  What kind of crazy stunt was that!"  You manage to break free, but he's not done yelling yet.  "I told you to fix the safety net, not the room lights!  All you had to do was turn on the switch in the junk room!  Just one little switch!"  He stops to mop his forehead, just as HIS boss enteres the room, leading his five guests.  "Great work today, men!  That was a brilliant recovery!"  Grinning, he begins pumping your hand.  "Why, if that light on the console hadn't started flashing, I never would have found the brakes!"  The rest of the evening passes in a blur.  You're a hero, at least according to your bonus check - and that's really all that matters.  More than enough to but a new top hat, at any rate.  Oh, but thinking of which... you really should have called and cancelled that date, huh. *** You win! *** In 72 moves, you have scored 10 of a possible 12 points.

[ACTION] buy arrow [STATE] You cast a critical eye on the items in the clearance basket, examining each from several angles, tsk-tsking and tut-tutting with slightly exaggerated disapproval. "You have only the one arrow?" you ask after a few moments. "Toy bow don't need but one," the proprietor responds. "One farthing for each piece in the basket. Or two for the lot," he adds. "A farthing for one arrow?" you ask incredulously. You pick the arrow from the basket and hold it up to your eye, looking carefully down the length of it. "And the arrow is out of true anyway. Not worth much of anything, is it?" The proprietor takes the arrow out of your hand and puts it back in the basket. "Don't make much difference to a kid, y'ask me. Two farthings for the lot," he repeats. "One. For the lot." You meet the proprietor's hostile gaze with equanimity. For one tense moment, it's a stand-off. Then, wordlessly and reluctantly, he holds out his hand. You pay him your one farthing, taking care not to move too quickly, and casually pick up the whole basket.

The refractive index ranges from 1.559 to 1.573. Twinning is common. As with all plagioclase members the crystal system is triclinic and three directions of cleavage are present two of which form nearly right angle prisms.
