[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] The Immortal An interactive sci-fi mystery by Rob Anthony Press SPACE to continue. Oooofff. A headache of unbelieved proportions. Grasping for breath, a small but desperate part of your wounded mind struggles to cling to consciousness. Something unknown, but absolutely terrible has happened. It's challenging to remain focused and alert, especially when pangs of desire for a chocolate eclair keep coming up. An image of a yourself, lying on the ground takes shape. Your belongings scattered about as if they were unimportant. Dark figures retreating. Too fast, the scene evaporates. Did that really happen? Other random feelings, images and thoughts fly by like daggers in a hurricane. Meanwhile an array of emotions rains down on an ocean of personal turmoil. Really big, turbulent waves of anger, rage and confusion spread across the vast surface while something sinister swims below. It wasn't always like this. Happiness did exist. Maybe whatever is happening is because of that dollar you stole from your best friend in second grade. You wonder about this as you begin to feel pulled toward a distant white light. The light seems to call out and provide warmth, safety and comfort. It could be good to move toward it. It might be the sane thing to do. Or it could be a trap, who knows? For a period of time you seem to simply float in nothingness. Pleasant, or at least less disturbing, dreams fill your lazy mind. You almost feel calm when something cold and wet brushes by your face. Cold fear grips you by the throat, but you kick yourself away from whatever is out there. The light comes blindingly back into view. Desparately, you push yourself toward the comforting embrace of the light. It envelopes you and a tingling sensation, like millions of tiny needles poking your skin, covers your entire body. Your mind explodes and is filled with the sharpest, purest and whitest brightness you have ever seen. Memory fades and later you awake standing within a beam of light. For the moment you feel that the nightmare of pain is over. Scratching your head you try to recall where you are. Slowly, a few fuzzy details begin to form. You realize that you have been here before. Other than that, everything is mostly a blank. However, for some reason you are wearing some kind of high-tech spacesuit and a large and familiar Samurai sword is strapped to your back. What does it mean? Where is this place? Where are you? Does it matter? If you need assistance, simply type HELP.

[ACTION] out [STATE] 1 / 11 > OUT As you step out, you see movement out of the corner of your eye. You duck down as sand flies by your head. You see a creature just outside the beam, gathering sand with its scale covered paws. Recognition fills your mind and you feel as if someone has brought the dead back to life. And, it smells that way too! With great revulsion, you begin holding you nose. You recognize one the foulest smelling creatures anywhere as a pitiful Hobgoblin. A dark corner of your mind contains a great many  details about these sad little creatures. The details don't all make sense, but you know that most of the creatures in the entire race never aspire to much, other than being mercenaries. They work cheap and they don't care what happens as long as they get paid and they don't care if you pay them with money, drugs, decaying scraps of meat, technology or gallons of putrid waste. As you step out of the beam, you feel a jolt of electrical energy run through your entire body. You gasp for breath and almost fall over. Staggering out of the light and onto the edge of a transport pad, you brace yourself for a moment at the railing. From above, a gentle wind caresses your body. The wind seems to carry words from some other time or place. The words fill your mind. You hear: "We are at war! The humans cannot help you." You rest at the railing for a moment and try to ponder these words. While you regain your composure the beam quickly fades and becomes less instense. A tug on your arm, rips you back to reality. The Hobgoblin, teeth barred in a horrible grin, is backing away and tightly grasping your watch. "Pitiful," it sneers while backing away. "Hey! Give it back," you say, sounding foolish. "Give food, get it back," it says waving your own watch at you. Soul Transport Chamber This large circular chamber seems to be a greeting center of some kind. The chamber itself resonates with a strong, temple like feeling. The ancient walls vibrantly enhance this feeling of spiritual importance. They are composed of hand carved, smooth marble blocks. Ancient carvings, faded with age, are etched and painted onto the surface of the stone walls. Tall stone pillars, which reach all the way up to the the expansive open ceiling, are evenly spaced along the wall. Through the massive viewport in the ceiling, the void, or whatever it really is, can be seen. Hundreds of dusty wicker baskets have been placed at the base of the pillars. A dull flicker of light flows up and out of the transportation pad, which is in the far side of the chamber, opposite the doorway. A marble railing surrounds the pad. A stone dias sits on either side of the only door. A great book rests on top of the left stone dias. The floor of the chamber is composed of soft flowing sand. Many different sets of footprints can be seen leading out. You can see a wounded hobgoblin, a dark robe and a sandals here. [ACTION] examine hobgoblin

To her right is Mother Nature and a few others from the Druidic faction. You never met any of them, save for Mother Nature, the big brute. Death stands and smashes a gavel down on the podium. She looks out at the crowd, clears her throat and says, "Let us begin." "I think we all know why we're here," says Mother Nature, standing and addressing the crowd. "We're hear to put a stop to your nonsense," says Death as a roar goes up in the crowd. "I don't see it that way," Mother Nature says. "How do you see," asks Death, but Mother Nature interupts her. In a loud and booming voice, which echoes throughout the hall, Mother Nature bellows, "Every Immortal should have the power to transform life, not just those of the Thanatos Faction!" Another cheer, although not as loud, but longer and more violent. "You mean, you want the power to take away life," Death says. But, the scene is fading. Somehow you can still feel the emotion of the meeting, even though you are standing back in the empty hall. Now the circumstances have become a little clearer for you, and you begin to understand that some kind of internal war has broken out between the various factions among the Immortals.
