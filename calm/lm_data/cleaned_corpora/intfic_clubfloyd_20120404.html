Locomotes and manipulates tools with four arrays of prehensile tentacles. Possesses thick, rubbery dermal substrates ranging from gray-green to blue-purple, covered in a fine layer of pale vibriassae extremely sensitive to changes in air pressure. Rudimentary eyespots permit awareness of light levels, and it has been proposed that their primary means of navigation is echolocation. At least four distinct auditory reception orifices have been identified, distributed in a radially symmetrical fashion. Eyewitness reports have compared the appearance of these sunken cavities to suppurating wounds as observed in Terran mammals. Respiratory anatomy appears to permit simultaneous intermission of gases from multiple orifices into multiple lung or lunglike structures, thus preventing these life forms from ever running out of breath. It has been proposed that a large portion of their muscular weight is devoted to their laryngeal anatomy, as they are capable of producing acoustic pressures in excess of 140 dB in a range from 16 to 16745 Hz. It has been proposed that they may possess a thoracic sac which allows them to generate such notably low frequencies, but although there are no external morphological indications to the contrary, this theory is unlikely to be proven by any means other than dissection.
