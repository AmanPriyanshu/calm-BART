Where did you learn that?" Keith whispers breathlessly. All tongue and fingers, he kisses the milky skin above your breasts, while your hands slide their way up and down his sculpted chest, so eager with lust that your watch occasionally snags on a stray chest hair. Your lips, glistening like two fresh strawberries laced with dew, hungrily roam across his neck. And your hips! Well, that's better left to the imagination. Normally, you wouldn't even consider seeing Keith at Pine Meadows, but Frank's in Boston and won't be back until tonight's banquet.  And when the cat's away... Just then, a low shelf wedges itself in to your back, jarring you from your reverie. That's when you hear it. A click. A flash. The tell-tale tapping of heels on concrete. Sting of the Wasp Interactive Damage-Control by Jason Devlin. (First time players should type ABOUT) Release 1 / Serial number 040622 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11 The next few minutes are a blur.  Keith juts his tongue down your throat, but, without you reciprocating, it feels like he's searching for cavities. The rhythms of your body no longer coincide with his. In fact, the only rhythm left in your body is the pounding of your heart, the warm throbbing of blood in your ears. He must notice your discomfort as soon he backs off and starts buttoning his shirt. "Well, I gotta get back to the Pro Shop, babe,"  he says, grabbing his shades. "Stop by later." With that, he takes off down the hall, leaving you, still stunned, slumped against the wall. Utility closet This is the first time you've been in this closet, and hopefully it will be the last. Keith assured you that no one ever comes down here. And now you can see why.  The concrete walls are oppressively close, made more so by the smell of bleach and chemicals coming from a filthy shelf against the far wall. Various brooms clutter the room, displaying none of the pleasant tidiness characteristic of the rest of Pine Meadows. All this can be escaped through a door to the south. Tossed to the side in the throes of passion, your bag, a fabulous Louis Vuitton original, lays on the ground. [ACTION] examine bag

[STATE] Tennis court Since tennis became passé, this court is mainly used by those few members who actually enjoy the game. In fact, due to the reduced use, the club has even begun letting non-members play on it. You've never been that fond of tennis and with the rabble about, you're loath to even stay on the court. Hardly a big loss. The net droops, the benches are peeling, and the rubber floor sticks to your pumps. Although you are fenced in on most sides, thankfully, you can still leave to the more agreeable outside dining areas to the northwest and north, or the garden path to the west. Beverly Winters, a long time member of the club, hops from foot to foot, waiting for a ball to come out of a serving machine at the other end of the court. Barely turning, Beverly starts talking. "Well, hello, Julia," she says, still not facing you. "Tonight's banquet should be interesting. No?" In a strangely crude move, Beverly shifts her bra uncomfortably.

This was back in the prime of Pine Meadows, before the computer boom, before the stock market became a playground for anyone with a couple thousand, before peasant blouses and the anti-fur movement; those were the days. Back then, the only thing to do was engage in dramatic rivalries. And what a rivalry you formed. Playful at first, it soon degenerated in to a spat worthy of the Hatfields and McCoys, that is if the two of you were troglodytic mountain folk. After dying down for a couple of years, the rivalry flared up again when you caught her flirting with Frank at one of last year's charity auctions. Normally you would have been happy to have his hands occupied for a few hours, but the insult was too great to ignore. [ACTION] examine net

In fact, due to the reduced use, the club has even begun letting non-members play on it. You've never been that fond of tennis and with the rabble about, you're loath to even stay on the court. Hardly a big loss. The net droops, the benches are peeling, and the rubber floor sticks to your pumps. Although you are fenced in on most sides, thankfully, you can still leave to the more agreeable outside dining areas to the northwest and north, or the garden path to the west. Beverly hops from foot to foot, waiting for a ball to come out of a serving machine at the other end of the court. In a strangely crude move, Beverly shifts her bra uncomfortably.

"Sorry about all I've put you through today, it's just I couldn't afford to let you know I had it until the banquet. You've proved quite resourceful so far. Who knows? Had you known it were me from the start, you might have just been able to stop me." She puts the photo back in her blouse. "Really, Julia, Frank and all his money deserve to be with someone a little more faithful than you. And once he sees this photo he'll realize who that is. Men are so easy to bend when vulnerable, don't you agree?" "Oh well," she says, turning off the machine and wiping the sweat from her brow. As she does, Beverly glances at her watch. "My, my. Look at the time. I must be getting ready for the banquet. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. I talked to Charles and told him about how it had been so long since I had seen Frank and he was more than willing to seat us all together. Isn't that wonderful?" "See you there," she says, throwing her purse over her shoulder and walking off. Beverly was right, the banquet is almost starting, which means Frank will be arriving soon. You run as fast as you can without breaking a sweat to the bathroom, toss your stuff in your locker, and go about making yourself look as presentable as possible. Quickly, you get the extra clothes from your locker, put them on, and go about fixing your makeup. Within twenty minutes (a Pine Meadows record) you are ready and speed your way to the banquet hall, drawing more than a little bit of attention: running is as rare as running shoes amongst these people. Luckily, your speed pays off and you get to the banquet just in time. Frank is just arriving and Beverly is nowhere to be seen, apparently your tampering with her clothes slowed her down long enough. Just as the doors open, Beverly comes racing down the hall with a sweater tied around her waist, casting you a dirty look as she does. With that, you are all ushered in to the hall. Banquet hall (at your table) Well, here you are, seated at a table in what amounts to the most horrifically uncomfortable chair you have ever been upon. An ostentatious centerpiece, surrounded by candles with a program leaning against it, sits in the middle of the table, its baby's breath bouncing perilously close to the flames. All around you, the din of diners talking, plates clunking, and air-conditioners whirring, fade in to the background, allowing you to concentrate on the problem at hand. Frank sits to one side, gazing fondly at you. Beverly eyes you suspiciously and pulls her purse a little closer. You nervously flip the menu over in your hands, absent-mindedly pretending to read.
