In a statement issued to all major news services, Officer Schultz of the European Police Force categorically ruled out a deep political plot as the cause of the abduction. "We live in peaceful times nowadays, and even the most obdurate reactionaries have learnt the danger of rocking the boat", he said. "This is probably an isolated act, with no major backing." He added that he was sanguine about being able to retrieve Mrs. Anderson safely. Noel Horton Pan European News Services. [ACTION] take disk

Dear Vanessa, Unforseen circumstances have forced me, without any sensible or honourable alternative, to leave you abruptly, without warning, without even the consolation - pardon my grandiosity - of a fond farewell. I have not been permitted to reveal more than this, even to you whom I could trust above anyone else, dearest - for the hand and mind that drive me at this moment are not my own. Rest assured that, if you still - regardless of your own safety - want to follow me, I have left enough traces. Not too explicitly, of course - Nash is a fine old man, but I wouldn't want to involve him in this - but I am sure you will find a way. The key can be revealed in the usual way: table, place.

[STATE] Feeling rather a cad, you read the letter once through, quickly.... Europe, July 14th, 2883. Dear Vanessa, Unforseen circumstances have forced me, without any sensible or honourable alternative, to leave you abruptly, without warning, without even the consolation - pardon my grandiosity - of a fond farewell. I have not been permitted to reveal more than this, even to you whom I could trust above anyone else, dearest - for the hand and mind that drive me at this moment are not my own. Rest assured that, if you still - regardless of your own safety - want to follow me, I have left enough traces. Not too explicitly, of course - Nash is a fine old man, but I wouldn't want to involve him in this - but I am sure you will find a way. The key can be revealed in the usual way: table, place. There is little time to say more. Four digits alone. Yours, Janus. After reading it, you feel strangely vindicated. At least, it was of some use, and could help you find a key to this enigma.

[Press SPACE......] Cold. Damp. Overdramatizing, as usual. You struggle to your feet, smooth down your crumpled coat, shake your head and brush the hair out of your face, a strange air of unreality (indeed!) surrounding you. Ideas that never entered your mind till this moment flicker by, leaving hardly a trace. You look ahead. Straight ahead. There is nothing more intimidating than your home ahead. So much for mystery. Your car has gone. But did you take it home, or did you walk? The last thing you remember was leaving the Court of Appeals.......nothing more.

BURIES CHARLESTOWN POLITICIANS --- From Our Special Correspondent The corrupt, brutal and unnatural orphanage of Charlestown has, through the miraculous intervention of Mr. Joel Sweeney, television personality, been all but routed. Although the sickening practices of the local politicians were known to many, few apart from the valiant Mr. Sweeney were willing to confront them face to face. "I do not give a cosmic egg", he told our reporter, "if the children in our institutions are well-treated; such yardsticks belong to the Middle Ages. Any system of education and development that does not liberate the inner self, and offer a holistic approach to spiritual development, is a monstrosity and a perversion." On the evidence of Mr. Sweeney, over 650 children - half of them orphans - were rescued from these dens of skepticism and placed along the right path. His close associate and friend, Doctor Osborne Sharma (the author of "Ingest, Assimilate, Absorb" and "Ageless Mind Over Ageing Matter") is actively involved in the process of rehabilitation. ANNOUNCEMENTS DECEASED : on July 26th, 1883, at his residence, LEON. E. GOLD, schoolmaster. Mr. Gold was recently under a shadow following the scandal in education. He is survived by his wife Judith.

[STATE] Workhouse, in Charlestown From its attitude of desolation, from its decrepit appearance, you realize that this cannot be anything other than that despised institution, the workhouse. Strangely, no cries, no disturbing sounds, can be heard though you strain your ears, and though the place is deserted and disused, there are no signs of outright squalor. The furniture is of surprisingly good quality, though probably second-hand, and there is nothing creaky about the floor-boards as you tread on them. The passage you came through leads north, and another corridor seems to leads east. Merging with the floor is a closed wooden door, probably leading to a cellar, an eerie light gleaming at its edges. The passage to the east is blocked by a black door. [ACTION] open cellar door [STATE] You open the cellar door. [ACTION] down
