Professor Hildebrand has not taken kindly to that F on your latest Science test. And now here you are in the science lab, facing a small angry professor, his beard literally bristling as he berates you in that faint German accent you've come to know so well. "You do not listen," he shouts, flinging his arms into the air in frustration, "it is as though you do not care at all about science!" He's right, of course. You don't. In fact, you're not really listening even now. Up to the point he says "fail" and "expel". That's not good. You probably should do something about that. "Gaah," says the professor, "I waste my time." He glances at his watch, "I will be back in 15 minutes. Please do not leave the room until I return. Then we shall see the principal together, yes?" Waggling his finger, he leaves the Laboratory and closes the door behind him.
