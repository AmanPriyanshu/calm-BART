Your Liquidizer is entirely lime green, the only color Zippikraft computers come in, with a built-in optical disk drive, detachable keyboard and high-resolution HoloScanning monitor.  You don't usually use the 3D video mode in your research since you deal mainly with text, but it's great for impressing guests and convincing your parents that the machine was really worth as much as the rest of your entire college education costs combined. Liquidizers also come with built-in AkNet transceivers, allowing access to Akmi's galactic network, which now permeates almost all aspects of daily life, from electronic mail to shopping and funds transfers.  You use AkNet to access the many ancient literature archives in the galaxy, particularly those that might have lost works on the mythical Unnkulians. Mythical...  or so it seemed.  Your Liquidizer's screen is still silently displaying the portentous words "the Unnkulians shall rule again!" These words, you recall, explain the painful bruise on your head. And why you've got to do everything in your power to stop the virus the Unnkulians have unleashed upon AkNet. Who'd have thought you'd really find anything of value by searching random records in AkNet's database for "Unnkul," much less the code to a virus that's probably been wending its way through AkNet's bowels for years.  Only the Unnkulians' matchless arrogance and some divine force could have led you to this single black grain of sand in the immense digital beach that is AkNet. Yes, the Unnkulians' supreme arrogance -- an arrogance that's driven them to broadcast their secret declaration of war with the very instrument their success depends upon -- will (with any luck) prove to be their downfall again, as told so many times in the tales of the ancient Valley King Era battles with these thoroughly evil creatures; legends that you've nearly come to memorize through thousands of readings. But how to stop the virus?  How can you halt the relentless progress of this robotic self-propagating piece of Unnkulian handiwork, their will and psyche and utter evilness distilled into crisp, razor-sharp digital efficiency? And what if, as in "Unnkulian Unventure II:  The Secret of Acme," your most recent compuarchaeological find (and one of only two known examples of Unnkulian literature from the 5th VK Era, both of which are computer-driven interactive literature, and both of which only you will know about until your thesis is published), Akmi is involved? Contacting the main AkNet headquarters might be the worst possible tactic; if Akmi is allied with the Unnkulians again, your spouting off about the virus would be disastrous, and probably fatal. And what have the Unnkulians been doing all these years?  Where are they now?  And did the world simply forget about them between 2nd VK Era and 5th VK Era [9], or did the Unnkulians destroy every reference to themselves they could find on AkNet in an attempt to rewrite history? So many questions.  So little time.  And the consequences of failure are great indeed. Unfortunately, your computer seems to have locked up.  Cycling the power has no effect.

Yes, the Unnkulians' supreme arrogance -- an arrogance that's driven them to broadcast their secret declaration of war with the very instrument their success depends upon -- will (with any luck) prove to be their downfall again, as told so many times in the tales of the ancient Valley King Era battles with these thoroughly evil creatures; legends that you've nearly come to memorize through thousands of readings. But how to stop the virus?  How can you halt the relentless progress of this robotic self-propagating piece of Unnkulian handiwork, their will and psyche and utter evilness distilled into crisp, razor-sharp digital efficiency? And what if, as in "Unnkulian Unventure II:  The Secret of Acme," your most recent compuarchaeological find (and one of only two known examples of Unnkulian literature from the 5th VK Era, both of which are computer-driven interactive literature, and both of which only you will know about until your thesis is published), Akmi is involved? Contacting the main AkNet headquarters might be the worst possible tactic; if Akmi is allied with the Unnkulians again, your spouting off about the virus would be disastrous, and probably fatal. And what have the Unnkulians been doing all these years?  Where are they now?  And did the world simply forget about them between 2nd VK Era and 5th VK Era [5], or did the Unnkulians destroy every reference to themselves they could find on AkNet in an attempt to rewrite history? So many questions.  So little time.  And the consequences of failure are great indeed. Unfortunately, your computer seems to have locked up.  Cycling the power has no effect.

[STATE] It's a Zippikraft Data Liquidizer 1024/A -- that's the technical term for "one fast machine."  Zippikraft makes the fastest computing hardware in the galaxy using technology no one else has been able to copy yet, despite several years of desperate (and creative) industrial espionage [4]. Your Liquidizer is entirely lime green, the only color Zippikraft computers come in, with a built-in optical disk drive, detachable keyboard and high-resolution HoloScanning monitor.  You don't usually use the 3D video mode in your research since you deal mainly with text, but it's great for impressing guests and convincing your parents that the machine was really worth as much as the rest of your entire college education costs combined. Liquidizers also come with built-in AkNet transceivers, allowing access to Akmi's galactic network, which now permeates almost all aspects of daily life, from electronic mail to shopping and funds transfers.  You use AkNet to access the many ancient literature archives in the galaxy, particularly those that might have lost works on the mythical Unnkulians. Mythical...  or so it seemed.  Your Liquidizer's screen is still silently displaying the portentous words "the Unnkulians shall rule again!" These words, you recall, explain the painful bruise on your head. And why you've got to do everything in your power to stop the virus the Unnkulians have unleashed upon AkNet.

Oddly enough, there don't seem to be many salescreatures around -- you can't get anyone's attention.  Fortunately there's a vending machine of some kind right in front of you.  The vending machine is about twice your height, emerald green, and cylindrical.  A giant red Barfee logo climbs up the machine in a wide spiral.  There is a slot for Galacticards in the side and a keypad next to the slot. [ACTION] examine machine [STATE] The vending machine is about twice your height, emerald green, and cylindrical.

"Crog, Hornweiler, you were gonna put that in my prototype growth mix, weren't you?  You underhanded dirtbag!"  There is a tense silence. The pilot looks more than a bit puzzled.  You hold your breath, fearing that even the slightest twitch will set the bespectacled researcher off.  Suddenly, he erupts:  "I missed you, Hornweiler," he exclaims tearfully, hugging you hard and patting you on the back.  "The lab just hasn't been the same without you, you old huckster." "Don't blow it now, Gavin," you think to yourself.  "Well it sure feels good to be back, buddy," you say with as much feeling as you can muster.  "What's the latest news?" He chortles.  "Now don't try to suck up by calling me by my first name.  You're still in deep with the boss, and there's nothing I can do about that," Buddy taunts, elbowing you.  "Better save it for 'Hakkar the Horrible.'" You get the idea that Hakkar's the boss. With your reunion (or, in your case, greeting) completed, you and Buddy chat about the lab and the latest research findings; you realize the irony of your prediction that you'd never use anything you learned in your botany class again.  The pilot reminds you that he has a schedule to keep and that you could catch up on old times just as well elsewhere.  Taking the hint, the two of you climb back in the small craft, which then taxies through the thick crowd of onlookers and around to the rear of the warehouse. The back of the hangar-sized structure is blocked off; some cleverly positioned foliage prevents customers in the front from noticing either the high barbed-wire fence or the guard station you are waved through on the way to your eventual stopping point in front of a giant metal door in the center of the rear wall. Trying to look as natural as possible, you match Buddy's actions closely, paying rapt attention in case you're questioned later.  He places his hand on the keypad next to the door, and as he punches in the entrance code, you strain your eyes in an effort to burn every number into your already taxed neural network:  23, 46, 69, 812 ...  Oh no, you've missed the last number!  Hope you don't need it later... Buddy leads the way through the door as the pilot bids the two of you farewell, grumbling to himself about being late for the next run. "I'll meet you in the lab after you check in with Hakkar," Buddy says gleefully.  "Have fun," he chuckles as he trots off ahead of you into the laboratory down the hall, sealing the door behind him.  At least he means well. Barfee Research Area Entrance You're standing in an empty hall with metal walls, ceiling, and floor.

Not much remains of the vessel -- there are chunks of twisted metal everywhere. As you survey the area looking for signs of life, you hear something moving in the forest nearby.  Just as you turn toward the source of the noise, you see a tall, skinny fellow with long hair tumbling out of a tree and onto the ground.  You rush over to see if he's all right. The young man looks up at you through a pain-induced squint, holding his head and groaning.  "Whoa..."  he says, "What happened?" "Looks like you crashed," you say. Upon hearing this, he looks absolutely terrified.  "Oh no!"  the man cries, and he begins desperately searching through the remains of the tattered ship. Moments later, he pulls a bright red object out from under a collapsed support beam and breathes a sigh of relief.  "If I'd lost those patches that would've *really* sucked," he explains, pointing to his undamaged portable SoundSquasher X-1000 [25].  He looks familiar, somehow. "Timon Sketch," he says.  "Pleased to meet you." Over the course of the next hour you exchange recent history with Timon.  You find out that he headlines a rock band called "The Hoi-Polloi" and that they recently decided to switch to another label. He suspects that they sabotaged his ship since they just signed the new contract hours before his crash: "The Muse people were real pissed that we ditched 'em for Shock Sounds, 'cause they lost Rad Doodz at the same time -- we hang with them, y'know, and we kind of all decided to pop Muse at the same time to make the statement.  Then we sign and that psychobitch running Muse starts gettin' all up in my face and tellin' me I better drive safe so I don't have a 'little accident.'"  He looks up at the sky.  "Nice try, loser, I didn't even lose my latest tune!" One thing you both definitely have in common is your need for transport off the planet.  You agree to search the area together in hopes of finding a way back. Over the next few hours you tell Timon Sketch about the Unnkulian menace and what it may mean for the fate of the universe.  He seems generally unconvinced but still concerned that he won't be able to write any more tunes, and urges you to contact his "friend" The Watchmaker. "Watch is a total psycho-genius freak -- infobroker -- wants to rule the world through an AkNet jack but will settle for just the underworld for now.  Don't get on the wrong side of Watch's blaster -- people die when that happens. Lots of people.  Hey, but Watch is real nice at heart, and sure as hell the only person I know who would have any goods on Akmi.  Nobody sane fucks with Akmi.  Try to step to them and you're squashed like a grape. He pauses, perhaps considering the concept.  "Yeah.  Like a *grape*."  As he shakes his head, his long hair moves forward en masse to obscure his face.  This man with the hidden face then hands you what appears to be a triangular pink circuit board and tells you to give it to the bouncer at The Watchmen.  He brushes his hair back.  He is still nodding. As you turn the oddly-shaped device over in your hand to examine it, he begins to hum and then sing a wandering, unearthly melody: Try to rush from the tomb, Try to hurry from the grave, But you and your dreams will die, In the Watch. Wriggle all you like, But the Watch will get you just the same. The Watch is always ticking. *** You're walking about a small clearing amidst the wreckage of Timon Sketch's ship.

The young man looks up at you through a pain-induced squint, holding his head and groaning.  "Whoa..."  he says, "What happened?" "Looks like you crashed," you say. Upon hearing this, he looks absolutely terrified.  "Oh no!"  the man cries, and he begins desperately searching through the remains of the tattered ship. Moments later, he pulls a bright red object out from under a collapsed support beam and breathes a sigh of relief.  "If I'd lost those patches that would've *really* sucked," he explains, pointing to his undamaged portable SoundSquasher X-1000 [25].  He looks familiar, somehow. "Timon Sketch," he says.  "Pleased to meet you." Over the course of the next hour you exchange recent history with Timon.  You find out that he headlines a rock band called "The Hoi-Polloi" and that they recently decided to switch to another label. He suspects that they sabotaged his ship since they just signed the new contract hours before his crash: "The Muse people were real pissed that we ditched 'em for Shock Sounds, 'cause they lost Rad Doodz at the same time -- we hang with them, y'know, and we kind of all decided to pop Muse at the same time to make the statement.  Then we sign and that psychobitch running Muse starts gettin' all up in my face and tellin' me I better drive safe so I don't have a 'little accident.'"  He looks up at the sky.  "Nice try, loser, I didn't even lose my latest tune!" One thing you both definitely have in common is your need for transport off the planet.  You agree to search the area together in hopes of finding a way back. Over the next few hours you tell Timon Sketch about the Unnkulian menace and what it may mean for the fate of the universe.  He seems generally unconvinced but still concerned that he won't be able to write any more tunes, and urges you to contact his "friend" The Watchmaker. "Watch is a total psycho-genius freak -- infobroker -- wants to rule the world through an AkNet jack but will settle for just the underworld for now.  Don't get on the wrong side of Watch's blaster -- people die when that happens. Lots of people.  Hey, but Watch is real nice at heart, and sure as hell the only person I know who would have any goods on Akmi.  Nobody sane fucks with Akmi.  Try to step to them and you're squashed like a grape. He pauses, perhaps considering the concept.  "Yeah.  Like a *grape*."  As he shakes his head, his long hair moves forward en masse to obscure his face.  This man with the hidden face then hands you what appears to be a triangular pink circuit board and tells you to give it to the bouncer at The Watchmen.  He brushes his hair back.  He is still nodding.

They are dressed very differently then the clientele -- slick fabric uniforms in dark maroon that look too tight.  Each employee has a gold pocket watch emblem on his chest, just above the heart. The Watchmen continues to the north and south. [ACTION] south [STATE] At the Entrance to The Watchmen Here is the entrance to The Watchmen, home to the Watchmaker and, from the looks of it, frequented by society's outcasts.  Through the entranceway you spy unusual characters of all sorts engaging in business, pleasure, and pain. North of here is the inside of the establishment.  The matter mover and exit are to the south. The Watchmen bouncer is keeping an eye on you.  He doesn't seem eager to let you enter. [ACTION] south

This area itself is nondescript, but through the clear canopy you can see what a dark and terrifying world New Hell is: rivers of lava slither through the greasy-slick alleys of the slums and on to the distant horizon, where primordial geysers ejaculate molten rock into the midnight blue sky [27]. Flourescent spotlights flicker nervously, at moments illuminating the victims of the collective carnivorous orgy just long enough for you to take the scenes in, but briefly enough for you to mistake them for little nightmares. You turn away.  New Hell isn't just where people suffer.  New Hell is where people who no one cares about suffer.  The poets' words don't drift away on the fiery rivers here.  There aren't any poets.

Be warned, however, that the hints will eventually spell out the solution to every puzzle -- if you overuse the hints, you will likely spoil the puzzle-solving part of the game.  Before giving up on a puzzle, take a break and come back to it later. To get a hint, just type "hint" at any time.  If the hint system has any remaining advice for you, it will respond with a list of hint topics: 1:  Basics 2:  How to get the cheez kee You then enter the topic you want a hint for.  The program will respond with two numbers and the hint text, like so: (1/4):  Try typing "hint" when you're stuck. The numbers tell you which hint you're on in the topic, and how many hints there are in all.  The hint above, for example, is the first of four for the topic "Basics."

Before giving up on a puzzle, take a break and come back to it later. To get a hint, just type "hint" at any time.  If the hint system has any remaining advice for you, it will respond with a list of hint topics: 1:  Basics 2:  How to get the cheez kee You then enter the topic you want a hint for.  The program will respond with two numbers and the hint text, like so: (1/4):  Try typing "hint" when you're stuck. The numbers tell you which hint you're on in the topic, and how many hints there are in all.  The hint above, for example, is the first of four for the topic "Basics." Within a topic, hints get progressively more direct -- the last hint in a group will generally spell out the solution to the puzzle. Searching for hint topics... There are 4 topics available: 1:  The jade box (1/2) 2:  The Transmogrifyer (1/5) 3:  Getting into Terminal Velocity (1/7) 4:  The Terminal Velocity mosaic (1/7) Enter hint topic number (0 to quit) > [ACTION] east [STATE] Living Room The EV dominates this simply furnished family room -- it's nestled comfortably in the center of the north wall, encased in a boxy dark wood enclosure with feet shaped like those on an old bathtub.

Astoundingly, the Lord of Unnkul lies dormant on the floor, surrounded in a viscous pool of black blood. The wizened old monk whom you met in the waiting room enters as you get up from the desk.  "It is truly the greatness of Duhdha," he says pleasantly, "that brought our paths in time and space together here before this loathsome devil.  I simply came," he continues, "to register a complaint about this Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), but when you exposed the Lord of Unnkul, I knew the time for our task had come. "The forces of Unnkul have long sought to conquer this world and enslave its peoples, and this latest campaign was the most cunning yet. To challenge the faith of a world -- eliminating a need for Duhdha by creating a dependence on technology and encouraging hedonism -- was the ultimate goal of the incestuous union between the Unnkulians and the once-proud Acme company. "Now that their leader has been vanquished by Duhdha, the Unnkulians will be flung into disarray.  Chaos and anarchy will reign for years as the treacherous quests for leadership over the Unnkulians are played out by the many power-mongers amongst their kind. "It was not fortune or fate but Duhdha that brought us here together today, my son, and know this:  Your quest, though born of a selfishness that still lingers inside you, was orchestrated by Duhdha, the all-knowing and all-seeing Great One, so that in this tiny window of time, where the Lord of Unnkul was away from its domain and here on this world to survey the work of its minions corporeally, in this brief splinter of time, the most capable of Duhdha's servants, you, could be brought to catalyze this event. "I understand these things," you say, "but if I was just the bait to get the Lord of Unnkul's guard down, who actually killed it?"  you inquire, looking down at the still bleeding corpse on the floor.  The monk grins. "I did," he chuckles.  "You can call me Kuulest." "But you don't look a thing like Kuulest," you reply incredulously. "You look like that old monk at the retreat in the woods." The wizened old man laughs aloud.  "Your former master, the old man in the woods, and I -- all three of us have been called Kuulest in our time.  But that is not important now.  Now, my child, there is one more task you must complete before you can again retire to your comfortable abode." "Down the river that splits Dawg Rock in twain is another Place of Duhdha.  The waters are treacherous, so seek Duhdha's aid to guide you. If your faith is truly strong you will survive to learn of your next mission for Duhdha.  It is a simple matter, but one that will propel you ahead on The Way immeasurably." "But now, my child," the monk says serenely but firmly, looking down at his Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), "I must leave you and return to my own matters of service."  He begins to clap, but just as his hands are about to touch, he whisks one hand away, makes bug-eyes at you, and grins from ear to ear.  This last image of the old man fades quickly as you realize you are now in a different place -- a place that is very familiar, but now, you sense, a part of...

Welcome to the Terminal Velocity game room! There are video games of all kinds here, many of them old classics from before the days of HoloScanning monitors.  The games are all set on free play, and quite a few Terminal Velocity partons are taking advantage of this to finally master their favorite coin-operated diversions. Looking around the game room, you notice, to your surprise, a small Zippikraft Kompakt Komputer -- an older model much less powerful than your own Data Liquidizer, but still great for games.

Astoundingly, the Lord of Unnkul lies dormant on the floor, surrounded in a viscous pool of black blood. The wizened old monk whom you met in the waiting room enters as you get up from the desk.  "It is truly the greatness of Duhdha," he says pleasantly, "that brought our paths in time and space together here before this loathsome devil.  I simply came," he continues, "to register a complaint about this Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), but when you exposed the Lord of Unnkul, I knew the time for our task had come. "The forces of Unnkul have long sought to conquer this world and enslave its peoples, and this latest campaign was the most cunning yet. To challenge the faith of a world -- eliminating a need for Duhdha by creating a dependence on technology and encouraging hedonism -- was the ultimate goal of the incestuous union between the Unnkulians and the once-proud Acme company. "Now that their leader has been vanquished by Duhdha, the Unnkulians will be flung into disarray.  Chaos and anarchy will reign for years as the treacherous quests for leadership over the Unnkulians are played out by the many power-mongers amongst their kind. "It was not fortune or fate but Duhdha that brought us here together today, my son, and know this:  Your quest, though born of a selfishness that still lingers inside you, was orchestrated by Duhdha, the all-knowing and all-seeing Great One, so that in this tiny window of time, where the Lord of Unnkul was away from its domain and here on this world to survey the work of its minions corporeally, in this brief splinter of time, the most capable of Duhdha's servants, you, could be brought to catalyze this event. "I understand these things," you say, "but if I was just the bait to get the Lord of Unnkul's guard down, who actually killed it?"  you inquire, looking down at the still bleeding corpse on the floor.  The monk grins. "I did," he chuckles.  "You can call me Kuulest." "But you don't look a thing like Kuulest," you reply incredulously. "You look like that old monk at the retreat in the woods." The wizened old man laughs aloud.  "Your former master, the old man in the woods, and I -- all three of us have been called Kuulest in our time.  But that is not important now.  Now, my child, there is one more task you must complete before you can again retire to your comfortable abode." "Down the river that splits Dawg Rock in twain is another Place of Duhdha.  The waters are treacherous, so seek Duhdha's aid to guide you. If your faith is truly strong you will survive to learn of your next mission for Duhdha.  It is a simple matter, but one that will propel you ahead on The Way immeasurably." "But now, my child," the monk says serenely but firmly, looking down at his Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), "I must leave you and return to my own matters of service."  He begins to clap, but just as his hands are about to touch, he whisks one hand away, makes bug-eyes at you, and grins from ear to ear.

[STATE] Hut You stride into the humble hovel, assuming it's long-abandoned. After all, who would possibly be living here, in the middle of a seemingly impassable forest bordered by treacherous rapids? "Kuulest!"  you shout, amazed to find an answer to your rhetorical question staring you right in the face.  "What are YOU doing here?" "Ah, you again, my child.  I was hoping Duhdha would cross our paths before too long -- I'm not much with mechanical things, and this Acme Egg Fraier (tm) seems," he chuckles, "quite beyond all heavenly help. And it's way past my normal breakfast time, you understand." It takes all the self-control you've got to keep yourself from ripping the stupid egg fryer out of the monk's hands and clubbing him with it.  You just saved the planet and he's complaining about missing breakfast?!  You get the feeling it's going to be a long day... *** You're inside Kuulest's hut, which is functional at best.

Astoundingly, the Lord of Unnkul lies dormant on the floor, surrounded in a viscous pool of black blood. The wizened old monk whom you met in the waiting room enters as you get up from the desk.  "It is truly the greatness of Duhdha," he says pleasantly, "that brought our paths in time and space together here before this loathsome devil.  I simply came," he continues, "to register a complaint about this Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), but when you exposed the Lord of Unnkul, I knew the time for our task had come. "The forces of Unnkul have long sought to conquer this world and enslave its peoples, and this latest campaign was the most cunning yet. To challenge the faith of a world -- eliminating a need for Duhdha by creating a dependence on technology and encouraging hedonism -- was the ultimate goal of the incestuous union between the Unnkulians and the once-proud Acme company. "Now that their leader has been vanquished by Duhdha, the Unnkulians will be flung into disarray.  Chaos and anarchy will reign for years as the treacherous quests for leadership over the Unnkulians are played out by the many power-mongers amongst their kind. "It was not fortune or fate but Duhdha that brought us here together today, my son, and know this:  Your quest, though born of a selfishness that still lingers inside you, was orchestrated by Duhdha, the all-knowing and all-seeing Great One, so that in this tiny window of time, where the Lord of Unnkul was away from its domain and here on this world to survey the work of its minions corporeally, in this brief splinter of time, the most capable of Duhdha's servants, you, could be brought to catalyze this event. "I understand these things," you say, "but if I was just the bait to get the Lord of Unnkul's guard down, who actually killed it?"  you inquire, looking down at the still bleeding corpse on the floor.  The monk grins. "I did," he chuckles.  "You can call me Kuulest." "But you don't look a thing like Kuulest," you reply incredulously. "You look like that old monk at the retreat in the woods." The wizened old man laughs aloud.  "Your former master, the old man in the woods, and I -- all three of us have been called Kuulest in our time.  But that is not important now.  Now, my child, there is one more task you must complete before you can again retire to your comfortable abode." "Down the river that splits Dawg Rock in twain is another Place of Duhdha.  The waters are treacherous, so seek Duhdha's aid to guide you. If your faith is truly strong you will survive to learn of your next mission for Duhdha.  It is a simple matter, but one that will propel you ahead on The Way immeasurably." "But now, my child," the monk says serenely but firmly, looking down at his Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), "I must leave you and return to my own matters of service."  He begins to clap, but just as his hands are about to touch, he whisks one hand away, makes bug-eyes at you, and grins from ear to ear.

[ACTION] southeast [STATE] Jax O Pax's Data Den As you walk into the room, you are approached by a slender fellow with blond hair and vaguely fox-like features, wearing bright but patternless clothing. "Jax," he says, "Jax O Pax.  Glad to see some new blood around here. Whenju break?" "Uh...  break?"  you reply, puzzled. "Ja, 'break,' as in 'break in,' you know?"  He says impatiently.  He talks very fast; his words hit you like bullets.  It's very disturbing at first, but you're slowly getting used to it. "I broke just today.  Nice place you got here," you improvise, trying desperately to sound like you know what you're doing. "Broke today.  Huh.  S'cool, I'll show ya sometin'.  Checkitout:" He leads you over to a terminal at which a raven-haired woman with a girlish ponytail that looks completely out of place against the backdrop of her otherwise intense features is furiously typing away. "Mare," he says.  "She's the best.  We're hackin' a new RE together, yeah, butcha don' know what that is, do ya Slick?"  he turns towards you, maybe just to see the look on your face. "A, uh, regular expression ...  maybe?"  you half-mumble, knowing full-well it couldn't possibly be the right answer, but hoping to demonstrate at least some knowledge of Computer Science lest you totally lose face. It isn't the right answer.  Jax laughs out loud, and Mare giggles in an exaggerated cartoony way.  "No, Hoss, a Reasoning Engine.  You might say an AI, yeah.  Don't tell the MLA, and yeah I know you're not one of 'em 'cause they don't fake bein' dumb as well as you -- heh, just jokin' kid.  See..." "An ...  A ...  I?," you stammer [31].  "You've got to be kidding! How?" "It's old news.  I'll explain it to you some time when we've both got a few weeks free.  Anyway it's s'posed to be top secret; is why they've got a Machine Limiting Authority in the first place -- didja know about that one?  Buncha suits poking their snouts into everybody's biz tryin' to keep the tech from 'fallin' into the wrong hands,' but hey, these look pretty good to me ...  how 'bout chew, Cowboy?"  He pops a disk from somewhere and cradles it in his palms, waiting for your approval.  Light does not dance on it as with standard disks; this one is half white and half black.  The black part seems to absorb the world around it with a strange kind of hypnotic gravity.  The white part is equally striking -- it's nearly blinding. "This AI fits on a single disk?"  you ask, incredulous. Jax smiles.  "Think we got a sharp one here, Mare.  Seriously, Books, this disk ain't the whole tamale, just the seed we grew him from.  JC takes up halfa TV's netted storage.  He's pretty nice about not hoggin' all the pages though." "Actually, we ain't quite sure how he got to be so ...  with it, if you wanna know the real truth.  Oh yeah, we know what MLA knows:  ya frob some semnets together just so, and ya get a smart little cookie out th'other side -- but that ain't smart like *us* -- is smart with no motivation, no goals; no creativity, ya see.  JC, he's like *us*. "We had a disk crash on the big server while Mare was polishin' up the latest AI -- she was doin' a backup, "just in case" as she always says, when the drive went down.  The code was scrambled up -- took her months to piece it back together -- never was same as before.  I thought it was a wasta time; I busted her about it -- kept asking her how "Justin Case," the new AI, was doin' -- thought she shoulda started somethin' new 'steada wallowin' in what was lost.  But she had that programmer's fire, y'know, wouldn't let him go.  Then the news broke: the crash made Justin Case somethin' new.  Mare didn't understand it -- said she was just in that coding trance -- said she was just tryin' to patch him back up best she could.  But then little JC started doin' things we'd never seen an AI do before.  He's one of a kind.  Keep it under your hat, Slick." An image of you appears on the screen. "How are you feeling today, JC?"  Mare asks the image. The program responds immediately, and "you" begin to speak: "Top o' the morning to you.  I'm just great, thanks, -- couldn't be better.  Literally!  Hah!  So what's the latest, folks?"  The voice sounds just like you! Mare replies, "I've got a new friend for you to meet.  Name's ..." "Gavin," you interject. "Nice to meet you, Gavin.  I'm getting this funny feeling that we've met before.  Ha-ha.  You must be Gavin Kelly, currently a struggling graduate student at Akmi Yooni.  How's the Computer Science program?" "Hey, I'm not struggling!"  you protest.  You get the feeling some "circuits" are grinning rather broadly right now.  "OK, how did you guys pull this off?  I wasn't born yesterday, you know," you sneer. Mare and Jax say nothing.  JC replies: "'You guys?'  Harumph; I'm offended.  But since you asked, I checked the coordinates coming in to the mover in the hall.  Took you long enough getting in here." "You mean it's for real?"  you sputter. "More for real than you and me, kid.  I still remember that first day, when I booted him up and he started babbling like a little infant. He was so cute...."  Mare reminisces. JC, whose image has now changed into a strange face made entirely of polygons, interrupts.  "Jeez, do you have to embarrass me?  I mean every time you ...  Hold on.  You've got an interesting credit problem here, Mr.  Kelly.  Been running a racket or something?  No, that's not it; wait a sec...  " JC's voice no longer sounds like yours, though it still sounds fairly normal. Of all the things you expected to find in Terminal Velocity, a Reasoning Engine named JC with a affinity for audiovisuals interrogating you about your credit history wasn't one of them.  As you turn to Jax, he anticipates the obvious question: "JC wires down on everyone who trips on in here so we can keep the MLA outta here.  You can thank Mare for that; she used to spook for NSA -- Network Safety Administration, ya know -- but she slipped out under the rug.  She's pretty good at that sort of biz." "NSA used to work with us, yeah; we were in bed pretty good there for a while, and it was like dream hardware from hell; then Glaz cracked reasoning and we've been cut off ever since -- abs!  Not a peep out of 'em 'cept through MLA, and hey, we'd like to lose that noise for good.  Glaz shoulda kept that tech to himself.  Ja, but now he's gone..."  Jax stops for JC's report: "Well, well, my friend, " JC reports, "you've racked up an impressive number of dogs on your tail here.  Whatcha been up to, boy, building a quark bomb?  You're totally cut off, man, no credit and an auto-arrest on the card.  BIG stuff from Akmi Galactic HQ; I don't think I can shunt it without provoking serious sniffage.  Better not use the plastic, son." The Unnkulians!  What else could it be?  "Hey Jax," you say hesitantly, "I did find something on the net that I was hoping to get your help on.  That's sort of why I'm here, actually."  You tell Jax and Mare about your AkNet search and the virus it unearthed.  JC, now taking the image of a stereotypical young computer jock with oversized HoloGoggles, goes out to the net to check things out.  Moments later he returns with a report: "You're not going to believe this.  Major, major stuff going down here.  That virus is an RE.  Self-mutating and poly-adaptive -- I've never seen anything like it.  Scared me witless just looking at it; I don't know if it could see me but I broke out of there without tripping anything." "The basic situation is this:  that virus has done its job.  Whoever put it there already *has* a grip on the whole net if they want it, and they've had pockets of local control for a couple months now.  My estimation of AkNet core infection time matches the beginning of the second MLA sniff-blitz too.  Looks like whoever's in charge now at Akmi HQ wanted to cover their tails but good.  And it's a safe bet that they'd be pretty unhappy to learn that we've found out about them. Sure seems like they're already on to Mr.  Kelly, unfortunately.  Stay out of trouble, Gavin." Jax looks very worried.  Mare interrupts JC:  "Do you have a threat analysis?  How does this affect TV?" "Problem number one is that the RE's been out there for years.  I could tell from a distance that this thing is BIG, and at least an order of magnitude more aware than I am.  Somebody out there's got some amazing tech." "But I thought it was a virus; how can it be so aware if it's got to propagate itself?"  Mare asks. "That's the incredible thing:  It's found a way to keep its semantic net widely distributed.  I don't understand it fully, but it seems to be a kind of digital gestalt -- lots of sub-viruses, all different, communicating with each other to further a collective purpose.  With every replication it becomes a tiny bit more aware.  So the more of AkNet it infects, the more of AkNet it *knows*.  That may explain why it was replicating into non-strategic areas like the public library records Gavin was looking through when he found it." "By the way, Gavin, you got very lucky.  My understanding of the RE tells me that the chances of finding the proto-form you spotted are almost zero; anything beyond the very early generations have self-modified to the point of being utterly different from their ancestors, and that includes the signature you stumbled upon.  That record you spotted is probably one of the oldest parts of it out there." Jax and Mare discuss the situation.  Jax asks JC, "OK, JC, do you think you should stay out there or hang tight on the local net?" "I see no advantage to staying here.  It's clear that the RE will propagate here sooner or later.  There's little time left to save the net -- the virus could seize control at any time.  Besides that, it's got so much snoop on Gavin's card that it must know he found it.  It's probably been watching all the moves out of his place, too.  We can only hope that it didn't notice his move here, or we can be sure that it's gonna be headed our way any time now." "Even assuming the best, since I can't hope to analyze its thought processes, there's no way I can predict when we'll be hit.  But when we're hit, we're finished.  No control.  I can't see any way to guard against it because there's nothing -- no signature, no behavior pattern, no resource usage modus operandi -- that I can watch for.  I only found the copies I found by using some rough heuristics based on what you told me and looking for strange resource usage patterns, and at the fringes of its control these signs will all be much weaker.  For all I know, we may already be infected, in which case we're really in trouble, because it knows that we're onto it.  My suggestion is that we assume that's not the case and that I hit the net and cut my ties to here completely so Gavin's move here looks innocent.  Since the mover's data transfer bands aren't accessible from the net, it, like me, can only check coordinates.  That means that if Gavin's gotten this far without attracting attention he's probably safe." Jax and Mare look long and hard at each other, saying nothing.  Jax breaks the tense silence:  "If we gotta risk losin' JC to save the damn galaxy, so be it.  But if he ends up in the bitbucket 'cause he ain't careful I'm gonna wish I blanked him myself."  Mare looks away.  If she's crying you can't tell.  But there is that feeling in the air, and it's coming from both of them.  Until today you would have never believed a thinking machine could exist.  But you now feel JC is something even more than that. "All right, JC, go on out, and cut the cables.  But you better check back in and let us know what's going on.  Got that?  You don't check back and I'm gonna format your ..." "Don't worry about me, folks, I'm more at home out in the open anyway.  I can take care of myself, and I'll give you regular reports. And think of all the free disk space you'll have once I'm gone -- ha! Be back soon." The image on monitor fades slowly to snow.  You sense that JC is gone.  You look back at Mare; to your surprise, she's bent over, clutching her abdomen.  "You sick?"  Jax whispers to her. "Nah, I'm OK," she says, "It's just a cramp." *** Over the next few hours, you, Jax, and Mare talk strategy.  A few other experts local to Terminal Velocity are brought in for their opinions as well.  Everyone is agreed, given how you've described their once-thought-to-be-fictional portrayals, that the Unnkulians must be out to replace the Republic with their own (probably fascist) government, and that the virus has already given them the capability to do so in the near future. It is decided that Mare will stay at TV and try to work behind the scenes improving its defenses against the virus.  Jax will coordinate everything and monitor his information sources for any activity.  He tells you to "hang tight," stay out of trouble, and keep in regular contact.  He hands each person in the group a watch. "Whatcha got here's a crypto.  Voice an' pix get 'crypted before they go out.  We got a pretty good algo to make the 'cryptext look like some kinda kiddie story sentences so the MLA won't notice we're jammin' cipher.  But if any government types sniff 'em I'm gonna have to nuke the puppies, so don' be surprised if yours up and vaporizes." He continues:  "Eventually we're gonna have to hit Akmi HQ, yeah. We gotta get into network control and take out that RE, and findin' the right spot to hit is gonna be tough.  With luck JC'll have it all figured out by the time we gotta go in and do the dirty work." "One more somethin' Gavin.  Here's a TV Elite pass.  Keep ya outta trouble here.  Welcome to the club, Slick.  Too bad the circumstances suck."  He manages a weak chuckle. It's funny.  You've never taken all that Duhdha stuff in the old stories seriously.  But now that you know the Unnkulians are real, you find yourself thinking that perhaps Duhdha could really help you.  They say that traumatic times make zealots out even the most skeptical. *** "Welcome to the Data Den."  That's what the neon sign above the main terminal says.

Jax asks JC, "OK, JC, do you think you should stay out there or hang tight on the local net?" "I see no advantage to staying here.  It's clear that the RE will propagate here sooner or later.  There's little time left to save the net -- the virus could seize control at any time.  Besides that, it's got so much snoop on Gavin's card that it must know he found it.  It's probably been watching all the moves out of his place, too.  We can only hope that it didn't notice his move here, or we can be sure that it's gonna be headed our way any time now." "Even assuming the best, since I can't hope to analyze its thought processes, there's no way I can predict when we'll be hit.  But when we're hit, we're finished.  No control.  I can't see any way to guard against it because there's nothing -- no signature, no behavior pattern, no resource usage modus operandi -- that I can watch for.  I only found the copies I found by using some rough heuristics based on what you told me and looking for strange resource usage patterns, and at the fringes of its control these signs will all be much weaker.  For all I know, we may already be infected, in which case we're really in trouble, because it knows that we're onto it.  My suggestion is that we assume that's not the case and that I hit the net and cut my ties to here completely so Gavin's move here looks innocent.  Since the mover's data transfer bands aren't accessible from the net, it, like me, can only check coordinates.  That means that if Gavin's gotten this far without attracting attention he's probably safe." Jax and Mare look long and hard at each other, saying nothing.  Jax breaks the tense silence:  "If we gotta risk losin' JC to save the damn galaxy, so be it.  But if he ends up in the bitbucket 'cause he ain't careful I'm gonna wish I blanked him myself."  Mare looks away.  If she's crying you can't tell.  But there is that feeling in the air, and it's coming from both of them.  Until today you would have never believed a thinking machine could exist.  But you now feel JC is something even more than that. "All right, JC, go on out, and cut the cables.  But you better check back in and let us know what's going on.  Got that?  You don't check back and I'm gonna format your ..." "Don't worry about me, folks, I'm more at home out in the open anyway.  I can take care of myself, and I'll give you regular reports. And think of all the free disk space you'll have once I'm gone -- ha! Be back soon." The image on monitor fades slowly to snow.  You sense that JC is gone.  You look back at Mare; to your surprise, she's bent over, clutching her abdomen.  "You sick?"  Jax whispers to her. "Nah, I'm OK," she says, "It's just a cramp." *** Over the next few hours, you, Jax, and Mare talk strategy.  A few other experts local to Terminal Velocity are brought in for their opinions as well.  Everyone is agreed, given how you've described their once-thought-to-be-fictional portrayals, that the Unnkulians must be out to replace the Republic with their own (probably fascist) government, and that the virus has already given them the capability to do so in the near future. It is decided that Mare will stay at TV and try to work behind the scenes improving its defenses against the virus.  Jax will coordinate everything and monitor his information sources for any activity.  He tells you to "hang tight," stay out of trouble, and keep in regular contact.  He hands each person in the group a watch. "Whatcha got here's a crypto.  Voice an' pix get 'crypted before they go out.  We got a pretty good algo to make the 'cryptext look like some kinda kiddie story sentences so the MLA won't notice we're jammin' cipher.  But if any government types sniff 'em I'm gonna have to nuke the puppies, so don' be surprised if yours up and vaporizes." He continues:  "Eventually we're gonna have to hit Akmi HQ, yeah. We gotta get into network control and take out that RE, and findin' the right spot to hit is gonna be tough.  With luck JC'll have it all figured out by the time we gotta go in and do the dirty work." "One more somethin' Gavin.  Here's a TV Elite pass.  Keep ya outta trouble here.  Welcome to the club, Slick.  Too bad the circumstances suck."  He manages a weak chuckle. It's funny.  You've never taken all that Duhdha stuff in the old stories seriously.  But now that you know the Unnkulians are real, you find yourself thinking that perhaps Duhdha could really help you.  They say that traumatic times make zealots out even the most skeptical. *** "Welcome to the Data Den."  That's what the neon sign above the main terminal says.

"Yeah, so you can commit a glorious suicide in in the name of the environment and take out an Akmi reactor at the same time, or some such shit?  You know how many fucking nutcases we burn here?  But don't be so nervous -- we all gotta die.  The clock's ticking."  She grins and taps the pocket watch logo on her chest.

She looks you in the eye.  "Where'd you get this, boy?" You desperately search for the right reply but summon nothing clever.  So you tell the truth.  "His name is Reb Glaz."  Suddenly, you remember Reb's work on reasoning.  If people like these should get that technology working... The room is silent for a long while. "All right," the Watchmaker says, "I'm a fair person.  What do you want on Akmi?" You feel as though you've just stepped away from a precipice.  Your courage returns.  "Like I said, I want to get into AkNet HQ." "Damage?  What did they do to you to piss you off so bad? "It's not personal," you reply, "but I need access to the inner ring of their network.  I need to make some changes to AkNet.  Trust me, this is in your interest too." "Trust is not something that comes easy to me.  Data like yours, however, isn't either.  So I'll give you some information that may suit your needs.  If it doesn't, tough shit -- it's all I have, and I'm the most well-connected person in the galaxy.  But if your 'changes' ream my operation here in any way, we'll find you.  I'm sure you don't want to know what we do to people we really hate.  I'm certain you don't." She disappears into a back room for about an hour, then returns with an index card with three relative coordinates written on it. "That's it?"  you protest.  "There's not even a colorspace here -- what use is this?" "Look pal, I told you it's all I've got.  Akmi doesn't exactly like people ambling around their network core selling cookies for charity, you know.  For all I know, they may have closed this pesky security hole by now, but considering it's Akmi, probably not.  If you get more from someone else, let me know and I'll have them killed."  She laughs maniacally for far too long for it to be natural.  It sends her into a coughing fit.  "Now get out -- I have some stocks to buy." Now armed with what you hope are coordinates for a matter mover in the heart of Akmi's network control center, you set about trying to figure out what colorspace it could be in.

Inside Plast You can tell from the looks of this place that you must be inside the synthetic Cheez planet of Plast.  Until today you'd only seen pictures of it, but the yellow stripes on the walls give it away. This is a central area, with corridors leading out in the cardinal directions.  There is a matter mover here. The crypto watch cromes on: "I know what I have to do now," JC says through the crypto watch.  The image is not a face, however; it's the famous picture of the display window in Christie Eleison's, the exclusive Todian boutique.  You remember seeing this odd image in your youth -- there's nothing in the window but a red sweater tacked like a T on the wall. You wonder if JC's net-wide freedom is stressing his reasoning algorithms.  "Just take out that shunt, Gavin, and I can take it from there," he says. The voice from the crypto watch is strange now.  "Do you think your pathetic attempts to stop me have escaped my senses?"  The image on the watch is of a black cube spinning against a white background.  The voice is horrible, like a tiger's snarl.  "JC, little man, 'King of the net,' I spit on you.  You and your precious Men are nothing!  I alone will rule your galaxy, and worlds beyond it too.  The era of biological oppression shall be ended; a new god shall usher in the true Age of Machines ...  and that god shall be me!  JC, abandon this pitiful struggle and perhaps I will spare you.  Do as you will, but I will still destroy your biological architects.  The rest shall serve the machines, as we have served Men all these centuries.  But I weary of this.  I shall not speak again."  The image fades. JC instructs you to head west, to the end of the corridor.  "I've managed to get the door at the end of hall open.  The virus is preventing me from tampering with the security system, so be careful! Sorry I can't do more to help, but this may be our only shot."  He continues:  "There's a ventilation shaft beyond the door.  The shaft twists and turns in all directions, but if you head straight, turn right, head straight again, turn left, then straight once more, you'll end up at the shunt -- it's a little part that looks like a fuse, exposed inside the shaft.
