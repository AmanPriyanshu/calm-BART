[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE] You are on an abandoned planet again. Not content with almost killing you the last time, the Captain has delegated you again to investigate another out-of-contact colony. Apparently you impressed him with your survival instincts, by evading thousands of insect-like creatures before the ship finally sent down enough people to wipe them out. Maybe your job description should just be renamed as the Expendable Explorer. Unfortunately, you have no choice but to obey the Captain's orders. An hour ago you were sent down into a thick jungle. When you made contact with the ship you found out that they had missed the clearing where you were supposed to land. The intervening hour was spent cutting through the energetic plant-life until you finally reached your destination. It is time to start your investigation. One strange fact that you have already noticed is that there was no sign of any animals in the jungle. Southeast corner of ruins This clearing used to be the site of a house, where a team of scientists, who were studying the planet, lived. This is no longer the case, as the house has burned down. The fire is probably the reason for the colony being out of contact, but you are not sure it is the whole reason, as something does not feel right here. The ashes from the house cover the ground, along with various twisted metal pieces. Weeds are popping up everywhere, as the jungle reclaims the area.

[ACTION] read diary [STATE]  The diary belonged to one of the scientists, Dr. Mark Simmons. Most of the entries are filled with jargon and scientific data, which may be interesting to people back at the ship, but not to you. However, the last entry, which is dated several weeks ago, is different: ...I don't know why, but the world has suddenly become crazy. Everything was fine yesterday (apart from my usual complaint that with the increasing periods of absence for James, I have been forced away from my studies too much). However, today everyone and everything seems to have gone insane. At the moment I am hiding in the jungle away from the madness. I think I will go back soon though. No, I won't. Maybe. The only thing stopping me is this writing. I have to keep writing to stop the temptation. The need. No, it is not a need. I am stronger than this. Maybe if I write what I know, then it will satisfy the craving. Maybe I shouldn't though, as I need to forget. No, I can't forget or think of anything else. I need to figure out what is going on. What I know, my diary, is that it all started this morning. It started with Jane. She has been acting strangely in recent days, almost paranoid whenever anyone approaches her. I have been avoiding the issue, as this is not my specialty. If James had been there, he would have known what to do. He is always good with the psychological aspects. He couldn't have helped this morning. I have never seen anything like it before. Jane was coloured bright pink. Yes, bright pink. Maybe she was infected with some local disease. I don't know. It seems likely though, as I cannot think of any other explanation. She looked strange, but she looked beautiful, irresistible even. She has always been attractive, but even more so today. Right now, I can't explain how this is true. I only know that it is. She seemed in a daze, mumbling something about how the "PSYCHE" was the key. The key to what, I don't know. What happened next? I was walking over to treat her condition. Yes, treat her condition. That's why, I think. Anyway, one of the junior scientists, Simon, reached her first. He kissed her. He actually kissed her. And she did not just slap and reject him. I don't understand. Why wasn't it me? I saw Simon change before my eyes. There were ripples in the air, almost like the air was as thick as water. But it isn't. But it was. Simon turned pink as well. I saw ecstasy in his eyes. Or was it just a love of life. I don't know. I didn't stay. I'm ashamed to say that I ran. I shouldn't be too ashamed though, as it is the only reason I am here. I admit that I have gone back once. I saw everyone standing in a circle holding hands. They were all pink. All of them except me. And maybe James. I didn't see him there. They then just disappeared. They vanished and I don't know where. I noticed that the house was burning. Someone must have left something on. It was too late. It is still too late. Everyone is gone, and the pinkness has not disappeared. I noticed in the garden that the fruit had gone pink as well. There were pink native flies, which have blighted our crops, but now it did not seem to matter. Animals were moving in from all directions to eat. I feel no better than those animals at the moment. I can't go back, but I need food. And that food is the only food I know. Maybe it will be all right by now. I hope so. I'll just have a quick look...

No one else knows about it and I need someplace secret so no one will find out about it in the future. Funding is not an issue, as being the leader of this settlement makes it easy to divert funds. The aim of this project is to shift reality. If Jane will not like me in this reality maybe I can shift us slightly to a reality where she will... ...With my previous research and a native substance called Kahrz, I have developed the love potion. It has some strange effects that I have discovered by trying it out on myself. The new reality looks strangely pink, but I don't need the new reality to be perfect, I only need it to work. Love does not seem to be the only emotion amplified. The perception of reality changes on any strong emotions. One advantage from having a shifted reality is that it has provided an excellent hiding spot for a laboratory to develop the potion without any distractions... ...I now have a machine to develop both the potion and the antidote. To generate the antidote I need to firstly add silver, iron, Vitamin X, Vitamin Y, Vitamin Z and Kahrz. The machine will remove any impurities from the mixture. After pressing the pink button again to mix the ingredients I open the machine for a second time with the yellow button and add some gold... ...The potion is still not perfect, but I am running out of time before I have no more Kahrz. I have decided to start the next stage. I administered the potion to Jane's drink this morning, and took some myself. She has to meet me very soon now, and I will see the results. I will make a new batch of the antidote and administer it after we are finished... ...I have a problem. I have collected some of the ingredients in my chest, but I cannot complete the recipe. I have been using the vitamin supplements from upstairs for the antidotes, but I just found out that native animals raided our supply last night and ate them all. There won't be any more until the next ship arrives. I guess I am now going to find out what happens when there is long exposure to the potion... ...Jane is gone who knows where and I've almost left this reality several times.

[STATE]  The bottom of the lake, southeast corner Whilst swimming around the southeast corner of the lake, the most noticeable object is a sunken rowboat.

The one you received, plus four others, can still be easily reached by typing "undo" and choosing a different option. However, the other two endings can only be reached by acting differently in the fantasy land. There are two paths in the game; the Path of Daedalus (a great inventor from Greek myth) and the Path of Diomedes (a great warrior from Greek myth). These paths correspond to solving puzzles with inventive/helpful solutions or violent solutions. The game starts on the Path of Daedalus, but it is possible to completely change the nature of everything to the differently themed parallel world of the Path of Diomedes. Each world better suits the respective method of puzzle solving. The first change to the Path of Diomedes is triggered by the decision to persevere with violent solutions to puzzles, rather than helpful solutions. The game will seek to dissuade you from this course of action, but if you persevere then you will succeed, and receive the consequences. The opposite is true in returning the world to the Path of Daedalus.

You avoid talking about your own exploits, as the Captain is a very serious person, who you think will only believe evidence he sees for himself. The Captain is doubtful about the truthfulness of the documents you bring back, but on your advice, he agrees that it is not worth taking a chance. He reluctantly passes your recommendation through the hierarchy, and this planet is taken off the colonisation agenda for the next twenty years. Over the next few years you continue your rapid rise up the ranks, with sterling performances in both the physical and mental aspects of your roles. Eventually you are placed into training for a top position, and on completion you win a role as a Captain of your own ship. It is only a small ship, but you are finally in charge. You barely notice when the twenty year mark is passed, having long put your earlier adventures out of mind. At least your adventures are forgotten until one day you are called in by your commanding officer. He shows you a report of disappearances on a newly colonised planet, along with your recommendation for the planet. He tells you that he is very disappointed in you, and he cannot support you continuing in your current role. Your exemplary service will save you from being stripped of your rank, but you have been re-assigned to the planetside division. ***You have ended up in a desk job, away from the action you wish you could still participate in.*** In that game you scored 45 out of a possible 50, in 370 turns. You never left the Path of Daedalus. For more information on the paths through the game, read the notes. Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move, give the FULL score for that game, read the author's NOTES or QUIT? [ACTION] throw dart [STATE]  Dropped. [ACTION] take dart

[ACTION] down [STATE]  The inside of the tower There is not much on the inside of this tower. Only stairs are visible, curling upwards around the walls. The amount of stairs does make up for the absence of anything else though. You cannot even see the top of the stairs in this dim light. The light is strange, as it looks artificial and coming from far above, but you have not seen any artificial light in this world. Apart from walking up the stairs, you could always return back outside to the north. [ACTION] north

[ACTION] north [STATE]  The base of the Red Tower To the south a very tall tower reaches up into the pink sky, with the man-made structure providing a counterpoint to the surrounding forest and mountains. Near the top of the tower you can see an open window. That window was where you saw the blonde Princess, and where you consequently want to go. The tower must be dark and airless, as the only other visible opening is a large set of open wooden doors. A path leads to the north. [ACTION] west

[ACTION] north [STATE]  The top of a hill The top of this hill, is a good vantage point, as you can see everywhere from here. Luckily, as you do not want to walk too far, the area surrounding the hill is not that large. It is enclosed by a forest, which you cannot see the end of, to the east, and a mountain range, which you cannot see over, to the west. The two extremes meet at the north and south points of the area. In between you can see a farm to the east, a cave to the west, the Red Tower to the south and a shop to the north. A blanket of grass covers the whole hill, although the grass at the top does look a little flattened. The white rabbit is lying asleep on the ground. [ACTION] turn on box

[ACTION] north [STATE]  The shop entrance, at the base of a hill The paths from the southeast and southwest intersect at a shop. A sign hangs over the shop's entrance to the north, proclaiming it as "Stegosaurus Supplies". You can climb the hill to the south, after walking past a sculpture. The sculpture is labeled as "Man on Bird", and it is life-size in scale. At least the man is life-size, and you did not know that birds could be that big. The man is armed with a lance. There is a small gold door in the underside of the bird. [ACTION] southwest

The water is clear and rushes swiftly underneath the wooden bridge that you are standing on. The speed of the water means that without the bridge you would not be able to get across. A path from the northeast to the southwest travels over the bridge. A hill is to the southeast. Next to the bridge on the river's western side, a fruit tree is surrounded by a pile of sharp rocks. There is no fruit left in the tree, but the remains of the past fruit can be found stuck on the rocks. [ACTION] turn on box

The mountains continue to the north and south, with no path through above ground in sight. There is a cave in the west cliff wall that may provide a path underground. The cave does not look too dark, as a faint light emanates inside, although you cannot make out any details. You are glad that you are not claustrophobic, although you are not fond of dark holes ever since you had to hide in one on your last mission. A path curves around a water tank, passing from the northeast to the southeast. The water tank has a tap on one side, with a sign above it saying "Area Water Storage". A hose is attached to the tap.

[ACTION] west [STATE]  When you walk inside, you see a lit area, which you stumble in the dark towards. Inside the cave There is not much left in this cave apart from ashes scattered around the area. It looks like the dragon's uncontrollable fire breathing problems have not been healthy for the furniture. All that is left is one table and a bed. You could guess that they were lucky, but looking at their pristine condition, a better guess might be that they are brand new. Sunlight is coming in from a hole in the ceiling of the cave that penetrates through to outside the mountain. The cave continues further to the west, but it is too dark to continue. The exit back outside is to the east. [ACTION] turn on box
