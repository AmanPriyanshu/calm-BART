Escaping from the Tomb of the Screaming Mummies had been treacherous enough, but then to have to go back inside because the professor lost his keys in some snake pit? Frankly, you had begun to question whether his treasure hunts were worth it. But the professor spoke persuasively about this new quest -- "for untold riches!" he claimed -- and, in the end, you agreed to join the expedition. Since then, things have gone exactly the way they always do: horribly. You tried to tell the professor that bringing a harpoon into an inflatable lifeboat was a bad idea.

[STATE]  Rainforest The dense canopy of leaves breaks up the sunlight. The ground is covered with a spongy layer of moss and ferns. The humid air smells of both flowering and decaying plants. Trails to the west and southwest meander through the trees, and the way back to the beach is east. A steep cliff rises up directly to the south, and to the southeast you see a steep climb that goes up towards its summit. A power station is poking out from among the ferns. Its glass dome is glowing with green light, and it is humming quietly. [ACTION] east [STATE]  Beach You are on a deserted beach, alone except for the salty breeze, the waves splashing rhythmically on the sand, and a single palm tree that provides very little shade from the harsh sun. The beach extends to the southeast, and a path to the west leads into the rainforest. The flat husk of a once-inflatable lifeboat has washed up nearby. [ACTION] southeast

Their many pockets and indentations are filled with pools of seawater. The beach becomes more sandy to the northwest and to the west, a large crack in the rocks leads down into a dark cave.

[ACTION] west [STATE]  Cavern The yellow light of the emergency beacon reflects wetly off the irregular, black walls of the cave. Drips of water echo from some dank corner through the chilly underground air. A path exits this chamber to the east, and a rusty iron gate leads west. A long ladder stretches up, past the limit of the beacon's weak light and into the darkness. [ACTION] west

[ACTION] west [STATE]  Workshop This cave has been turned into a small workshop with an assortment of furniture on one side and an array of machinery on the other. Everything in the room is damp from the constant mist churned up by the cascade of falling water at the cave's entrance, which lies to the west. There is a rusty iron gate in the eastern wall. Among the machinery is the room's most impressive feature: a massive water wheel, which is attached to a long horizontal track in the wall. At the near end of the track you see a crank and a kind of display panel. [ACTION] examine panel

From here you can see that this island is just one of many that make up an archipelago. You notice a ship several miles away sailing in and out of sight among the many islands. In the center of the room is the lantern: a high-powered electric lamp nested inside a set of massive rotating lenses. Underneath the lens array, on the lantern's support pedestal, is a large power button. [ACTION] press button
