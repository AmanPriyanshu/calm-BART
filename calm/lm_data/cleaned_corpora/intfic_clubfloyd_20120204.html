[pausing to show unread error message] PREFACE This account of the wedding at Cana, by the servant Micah, was considered apocryphal as early as the third century; it was therefore excluded from consideration at the Synod of Hippo in AD 393.  Various surviving texts, notably the writings of Julius of Damascus and of Nestor of Nice, suggest that the account was a late fiction based on the relevant verses in the Gospel of John, intended perhaps as instruction to the faithful. Of particular interest is the fact that the account was written in the second person, and in liturgical Hebrew instead of the more common Greek or Aramaic of the time.  This latter point implies that "Micah" is not a lowly servant as described in the story, but a mouthpiece, a fictional character through which the actual author -- a much more learned person who might or might not be named Micah -- might speak; whereas the former point supports the hypothesis of Nestor of Nice that the author's primary intention was to engage the reader in the action of an already-existing story, rather than to present an actual eyewitness account.

Amos scurries off to do as he's told, and Martha turns to you: "And Micah, you see if you can find that missing jug!" Martha hurries off after Amos, through the back garden, avoiding the other guests and leaving you with your half of the mission.  Where on earth could that missing wine jug be?

Various surviving texts, notably the writings of Julius of Damascus and of Nestor of Nice, suggest that the account was a late fiction based on the relevant verses in the Gospel of John, intended perhaps as instruction to the faithful. Of particular interest is the fact that the account was written in the second person, and in liturgical Hebrew instead of the more common Greek or Aramaic of the time.  This latter point implies that "Micah" is not a lowly servant as described in the story, but a mouthpiece, a fictional character through which the actual author -- a much more learned person who might or might not be named Micah -- might speak; whereas the former point supports the hypothesis of Nestor of Nice that the author's primary intention was to engage the reader in the action of an already-existing story, rather than to present an actual eyewitness account.

Various surviving texts, notably the writings of Julius of Damascus and of Nestor of Nice, suggest that the account was a late fiction based on the relevant verses in the Gospel of John, intended perhaps as instruction to the faithful. Of particular interest is the fact that the account was written in the second person, and in liturgical Hebrew instead of the more common Greek or Aramaic of the time.  This latter point implies that "Micah" is not a lowly servant as described in the story, but a mouthpiece, a fictional character through which the actual author -- a much more learned person who might or might not be named Micah -- might speak; whereas the former point supports the hypothesis of Nestor of Nice that the author's primary intention was to engage the reader in the action of an already-existing story, rather than to present an actual eyewitness account. Be that as it may, it is hoped that this translation will prove to be as edifying to the modern scholar as its original author, whoever that might be, had intended. - Rev.

You look up from your inspection of the wine jug in time to see Martha and Amos bustle into the kitchen.  You can tell from the looks on their faces that their mission has not been a success.  "The only merchant still in the market was a man selling lamp oil," Martha tells you, "he said he'd gotten a very last-minute order for six jars of the stuff, and was hoping there'd be more to come."  She sighs and glances at the wine jug.  "At least you've been successful.  If we water it down a little...." You confess that, as far as you know, watering down the wine is not going to be an issue.  Martha groans.  "I'll go tell Clopas," she says, "and see if I can distract the other guests somehow.  I don't know what else I can do."  Taking a deep breath, she marches out into the courtyard like a brave little Maccabean. Amos, who really should have been the one to inform Clopas, fidgets distractedly and finally pulls out a bowl of dough and proceeds with the baking for the morrow. [ACTION] south

[STATE] Rocks and clay, thick and muddy and wonderful if you were a potter, which you aren't. [ACTION] examine tree [STATE] More dead than alive, the tree looks like dead hand clawing at the sky. You hear a nasty snapping sound from above, and duck aside just in time.  A red-headed man lands on the rocks right beside you with a sound you'd rather not ever hear again.  An attempted suicide, if the broken noose about his neck is anything to go by.  With a start, you recognise him as Judas Iscariot, one of Joshua's friends.  Has Joshua's execution really affected him that badly? [ACTION] examine judas

He is very still, and for a moment you think he's dead, and then you hear him go on: "I have sinned.  My teacher has been executed by crucifixion ... I betrayed him ... with a kiss, I betrayed him...." You draw back, startled, remembering your own experience with John ben Zechariah and Herod's soldiers.  Judas doesn't notice.  "Is there forgiveness?  I should have sought forgiveness ... they would not have forgiven me ... I don't know that ... I didn't dare ... I was afraid ... and so I damn myself...." Suddenly, his eyes snap open, and he looks straight at you.  "Blessed are the merciful," he says, a little louder than you would have thought possible, "they shall have mercy shown upon them."  And then he really is gone. [ACTION] search judas

Neither John nor his father are still among the living, but there's Joshua's mother ... his closest friends, who'll want to know of Judas's fate ... and Clopas usually has some business in Emmaus at this time of the year, you might be able to catch him there.... It's time to get some things off your chest. *** Nothing is beyond redemption *** Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command? [ACTION] yes
