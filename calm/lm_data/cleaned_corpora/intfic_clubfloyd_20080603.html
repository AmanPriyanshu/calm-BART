[ACTION] inventory [STATE] 2 Automatic Typo Correction The Elysium Enigma incorporates Steve Breslin's Spelling Corrector extension, which can correct some typos for you.  For example, if you type: >X PLIOT Then, depending on context, the game may be able to correct this to: >X PILOT And proceed to execute the appropriate command.  This can be very useful in correcting minor errors automatically, rather than presenting you with a parser error and the need to retype a command, but there are two things you should note about this feature: (1) This library extension (rightly) takes a conservative approach to typo-correction, making only those corrections that are very likely to be correct, rather than risking speculative corrections that were not what the player intended.  This means that you may often find that the game does not correct a typo that looks obvious to you.  In such a case the reason is probably that the correction was not so obvious to the algorithm used by the spelling corrector; it's far better not to have the game "correct" your input to something you didn't intend and execute a command you didn't want. (2) For this reason, no automatic typo correction occurs in conversational commands (like ASK and TELL) and other such commands where any input is potentially valid.  For example, you can ask an NPC about anything you like, so it would be highly annoying to have: >ASK BOB ABOUT LOVE "corrected" to: >ASK BOB ABOUT MOVE Which might happen if "move" but not "love" is one of the words defined in the game's dictionary. (3) Should you find this typo-correction feature more of a hindrance than a help you can disable it with the TYPO OFF command.  Use TYPO ON command to turn it back on (you can also use the bare TYPO command to toggle the two states). [The End] [ACTION] press green

"There, sir," the shuttle pilot points to a tiny collection of buildings nestling next to the river, "That's the town." "That's the town!" you cry, "Are you sure, sublieutenant?" "Quite sure, sir," the pilot assures you as she checks her navigational instruments, "Which means our designated landing zone should be just the other side of that forest." You let out a deep sigh as the shuttle carries out its final descent over the farmland and turns to sweep over the multi-coloured trees. It's not that you have any objection to walking per se, indeed the prospect of a good brisk walk on a sunny morning is rather appealing after four days cooped up in a frigate; it's being obliged to walk to this meeting just to avoid upsetting the natives' technophobic sensibilities that irritates you. The pilot now has the shuttle under manual control; she kills the speed and drops the craft into a hollow just north of the forest.  As she finally cuts the engines she turns to you with a brisk smile. "Right, here we are, sir," she announces cheerfully.  Pointing to the south she adds, "The town should be about a quarter of an hour's walk that way.  I think I spotted a path running more or less straight through the forest, so you shouldn't have any difficulty finding it." "Thanks," you reply laconically.  You let out another sigh; but at least this shouldn't take more than a couple of hours, then you'll be away from this wretched backwater - hopefully for good.

As a result, we need you to include Elysium in your rounds.  It's a sensitive planet - probably one of the most sensitive settlements in the Empire - but provided you go straight in and straight out and stick strictly to these orders you shouldn't have any problems. The purpose of your visit is simply to remind the local leadership that they are still part of the Empire and that we are still keeping tabs on them; quite literally, you're just there to 'show the flag'. To do this you'll need to make your way to the Legion office in what passes for the settlement's capital, and, once there, hoist the imperial flag above the building to show the local Elders that you're open for business.  One or more of them should then come to call on you within the hour.  When they do, be as diplomatic and courteous as possible, but otherwise keep the conversation to a minimum.  Inform them in the simplest possible terms of the nature of the Federation crisis, emphasising that the Empire will continue to guard them from intrusion. Ask them if they have anything they want to raise with you. Almost certainly they won't, apart from their standard grumbles about imperial interference.  Say as little as possible in reply beyond promising to pass their comments on.  Once you have completed this conversation get out of there as quickly as you can. The most important thing to understand about the Elysians is that they have made a religion of technophobia.  Their idea of a paradisal society is a pre-industrial society, so try not to flaunt any technology you bring with you; the less the settlers see of any thirtieth-century technology, the better you'll get on with them. Finally, I cannot stress too strongly that you should on no account get involved in any of the internal affairs of Elysium, and that you should if at all possible avoid any contact with any of the settlers apart from the Elders who come to meet you.  Terrible mistakes have been made on Elysium in the past, and any problems that come up in the present must be left to officers with a deep understanding of the situation there, which does not include you.

[ACTION] examine drik [STATE] You have no idea where the name "drik" came from; so far as you know that's what it's been called for centuries.  The drik is a multipurpose device that's issued to all Legion officers as standard. Despite the natives' dislike of modern technology, this is one item you're not prepared to go without - it was drummed into you at the Legion Training School that a Legion Officer's drik is an integral part of his uniform, never to be lost or surrendered under any circumstances. The drik is vaguely dagger-shaped, with a black handle, on which are four small coloured studs, and a slightly longer "blade", a flat plastimetal strip that is not actually sharp enough to cut anything. The drik has one further function in addition to that provided by its four studs: although you're unlikely to encounter much strange technology on Elysium, if you do encounter something you're suspicious of, pointing your drik at it may reveal something about its function.

Increased productivity would allow us to employ the surplus native labour thereby created in munitions factories to supply our forces; needless to say we should have to set up such factories ourselves, but the natives, though primitive, do not seem unduly stupid and could certainly be trained to work in such factories. Such a scheme would enable us to sustain a sizeable fleet in the Elysium system indefinitely, apart from an imperial counter-attack. Holding an imperial world deep in imperial space may be of both strategic and propaganda value to us. Whether the capture of Elysium would in fact be strategically worthwhile is beyond my brief to determine.  My initial survey indicates that it would be tactically feasible.

[STATE] "What have you got there?"  Leela wants to know, as you pick up the diary "Do show me!" [ACTION] read book [STATE] It appears to be the diary of one Subcenturion Mark Villiers, who served as the representative of the Imperial Police Corps on this planet in the early twenty-eighth century, about a quarter of a millenium ago, when Elysium was newly colonized.  It seems that Villiers was posted here to enforce a modicum of imperial law and order on the new settlement, but that the settlers proved as difficult back then as they have done ever since. As you flick over the pages you find a series of accounts of ongoing friction between the uncooperative Elders and the increasingly frustrated Villiers.  Some of the other natives seemed to have been reasonable enough, and as Villiers's account progresses it becomes clear that he was becoming increasingly friendly with one young woman in particular, but the Elders were consistently obstructive, insisting that the maintenance of law on Elysium was their job and theirs alone, and no business of the Empire.  Even when news of some petty crime did come Villiers's way, the Elders would frustrate every attempt the subcenturion made to investigate it. On the last few pages the tone becomes even darker.  Villiers apparently believed that someone - one of the settlers called Natasha with whom he had become quite friendly - had been murdered, and he was determined to bring the killer to justice.  The Elders proved particularly intransigent, denying that any crime had taken place that they weren't perfectly capable of taking care of.  It's clear from the diary that this made Villiers increasingly angry: if a murder had been committed it was clearly a matter for the imperial authorities, and all the settlers, Elders included, were duty-bound to co-operate. On the final page, the entry for July 14 2722, the diary concludes with the words, "I am now morally certain that Natasha was murdered, and I now have a pretty good idea where to find her body and the proof I need to bring her killers to justice.  Poor Natasha!  Always too much of a free spirit for this narrow little planet, and now she's paid the ultimate price for her broad-mindedness and her enquiring mind.  But I am determined to bring matters to a head, despite veiled threats from the Elders. And now, I'm just off to follow up my latest lead; I'll fill in the details on my return."

As you flick over the pages you find a series of accounts of ongoing friction between the uncooperative Elders and the increasingly frustrated Villiers.  Some of the other natives seemed to have been reasonable enough, and as Villiers's account progresses it becomes clear that he was becoming increasingly friendly with one young woman in particular, but the Elders were consistently obstructive, insisting that the maintenance of law on Elysium was their job and theirs alone, and no business of the Empire.  Even when news of some petty crime did come Villiers's way, the Elders would frustrate every attempt the subcenturion made to investigate it. On the last few pages the tone becomes even darker.  Villiers apparently believed that someone - one of the settlers called Natasha with whom he had become quite friendly - had been murdered, and he was determined to bring the killer to justice.  The Elders proved particularly intransigent, denying that any crime had taken place that they weren't perfectly capable of taking care of.  It's clear from the diary that this made Villiers increasingly angry: if a murder had been committed it was clearly a matter for the imperial authorities, and all the settlers, Elders included, were duty-bound to co-operate. On the final page, the entry for July 14 2722, the diary concludes with the words, "I am now morally certain that Natasha was murdered, and I now have a pretty good idea where to find her body and the proof I need to bring her killers to justice.  Poor Natasha!  Always too much of a free spirit for this narrow little planet, and now she's paid the ultimate price for her broad-mindedness and her enquiring mind.  But I am determined to bring matters to a head, despite veiled threats from the Elders. And now, I'm just off to follow up my latest lead; I'll fill in the details on my return." But it seems Subcenturion Villiers never did return, for there his account ends. You can smell the cheese. (Your score has just increased by one point.)

"How sad!" she declares as she reaches the last page, "that poor Natasha - she sounds a bit like me, really - I wonder what the Elders did to her.  And Mark Villiers, the person who wrote this, that's the man whose grave we just found, isn't it?  So we know how he ended up.  I wonder if he found justice for Natasha first." She closes the diary and hands it back to you. [ACTION] north

"I found this diary in the forest; I thought you might find it interesting," you tell him. Petroc hesitates for a moment, then takes the diary from you and reads it slowly.  At length, he looks up at you again, and remarks, "If you're as clever as you think you are, you should be able guess the rest.  This man Villiers poked his nose in where it wasn't welcome. He came to a sticky end.  Eventually your people sent someone else along to find out what had happened to him.  My ancestors believed justice had been done, but yours didn't, so they sent a gang of warriors here.  Things quickly got out of hand - some of our young men went along to the old town with sticks and stones to chase your warriors away, and your warriors retaliated with their weapons of terror.  It was a massacre, a terrible bloody massacre, so terrible that even your ancestors were ashamed of it.  Anyway, no one wanted the old town after that, it had too many bad memories for all of us, so we abandoned it, and rebuilt here - but still you wouldn't leave us alone."  He pauses, and looks at you with something like pity as he hands the diary back to you, "So now you know - all your great empire has done for us." (Your score has just increased by one point.)
