Parlour The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in the fireplace.

"Oh ... are those your Uncle Stephen's old sermons?  So that's what you were after!  You should have just said so.  I see I should have trusted you enough to know you could not possibly mean any mischief when you leave your seat." She actually smiles and pats you on the head.

On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly claustrophobic.  Escape seems most likely either east into the hall or north into the dining room. An armchair, which years of visits have accustomed you to thinking of as "your" armchair, is positioned near the fireplace. On the mantel are a displaced gnomon, a snake locket, a white cat, a wooden goblet, a flower saucer, a ship painting, a black falcon, a glass unicorn and a duelling pistol, all half hidden in a crowd of other little ornaments. From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes benignly down on the room. Aunt Emma sits by the window, dutifully reading her Bible. [ACTION] show letter to emma
