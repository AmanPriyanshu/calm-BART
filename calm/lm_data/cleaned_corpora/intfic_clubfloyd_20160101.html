Bold, ambitious, and charismatic, she inspires you to be the best railor you can be. [ACTION] glossary [STATE]  CROSS: The places where two tracks meet, or cross. DEADLYNDS: An area of the moorsea devoid of life. Not even the heath grows there. It's rumoured the rebellion against the Empire is hiding their base of operations in the deadlynds. HOTLINE: Any track containing a HOTWIRE, or the wire that provides the energy for locomotion (it's not yet understood how this works). The hotwire is named for how it burns hot to the touch. The other type of track is a DOCKING TRACK, in which the hotwire has been snipped to allow the trolley to come to a stop. IRONS: Another name for the rails. The phrase PRESSING HER HARD AGAINST THE IRONS is an expression meaning to ride the trolley at a maximum speed. Those who maintain the tracks are called IRONSWORKERS. JOLLY ROGER: A symbol used by pirates for mysterious ends. It's usually depicted as a skull over a pair of crossed bones. MOORSEA: A great expanse of moors. It's thought to stretch thousands upon thousands of miles, though none have explored beyond the deadlynds. Only a complicated network of tracks left by an unknown civilization enables travel, as the moors are covered by a toxic plant called the HEATH. RAILOR: A member of a trolley's crew. SPLIT: A type of cross where it's possible to change tracks. To JUMP THE SPLIT means to change tracks, while to RUN THE SPLIT means to continue without changing. SWITCH: A device that allows the trolley to change tracks at a split. The expression FLY THE SWITCH means to push the switch while the trolley is still in motion, typically with the aid of a long pole. This technique will not work if the trolley is travelling at too fast a speed. TAFF: The railing along the front of the trolley, over the bow. Many trolleys carry a harpoon cannon, which is usually secured to the taff. TIES: Planks of wood that lie perpendicular to the rails and secure them in place. Because of their uniform spacing, the term has become a standard unit of distance. The term can also be used to measure speed when counting the number of ties the trolley passes per second. The phrase COUNTING TIES refers to the fact that when travelling slow enough, one can easily count the ties appearing behind the trolley. TRACKWARD: The direction the trolley is moving. Its opposite is BACKWARD. TROLLEY: A single mechanical carriage used to travel the rails. Long ago, people rode multiple carriages joined together called trains, but they proved unwieldy in battle, difficult to defend against pirates, and subject to frequent wrecks due to the large number of crosses. Trolleys are easily repaired or replaced, and only require crews of two to ten railors. [ACTION] count ties
[STATE]  CROSS: The places where two tracks meet, or cross. DEADLYNDS: An area of the moorsea devoid of life. Not even the heath grows there. It's rumoured the rebellion against the Empire is hiding their base of operations in the deadlynds. HOTLINE: Any track containing a HOTWIRE, or the wire that provides the energy for locomotion (it's not yet understood how this works). The hotwire is named for how it burns hot to the touch. The other type of track is a DOCKING TRACK, in which the hotwire has been snipped to allow the trolley to come to a stop. IRONS: Another name for the rails. The phrase PRESSING HER HARD AGAINST THE IRONS is an expression meaning to ride the trolley at a maximum speed. Those who maintain the tracks are called IRONSWORKERS. JOLLY ROGER: A symbol used by pirates for mysterious ends. It's usually depicted as a skull over a pair of crossed bones. MOORSEA: A great expanse of moors. It's thought to stretch thousands upon thousands of miles, though none have explored beyond the deadlynds. Only a complicated network of tracks left by an unknown civilization enables travel, as the moors are covered by a toxic plant called the HEATH. RAILOR: A member of a trolley's crew. SPLIT: A type of cross where it's possible to change tracks. To JUMP THE SPLIT means to change tracks, while to RUN THE SPLIT means to continue without changing.

Here the buildings are little more than ragged tarps stretched over the husks of trolleys and other scavenged materials. The roof of one dwelling, an ancient caboose, makes use of an old flag to patch a hole, its bold red hue long since faded to a dirty shade of terra cotta. You're reminded of a blanket your mother had made to keep you warm at night. Back then, the Empire's flags were always in abundance, and few seemed to mind the ones that went missing. Now, no one dares remove a single flag, not since the guard began removing hands. The Captain's voice distracts you from your thoughts. "First Mate Gertie, there's a fool on the approach!" Sure enough, you see a man dancing on the track, cradling his bottle of spirits like it's his partner in a very sloppy waltz. Ordinarily you'd ring a standard warning, but the trolley's bell went the way of her roof. Something near him catches the sunlight—a switch! "Look Captain!" you shout excitedly. Then you remember the harpoon. "We could at least try to fly the switch." The Captain shakes her head. "I have a better idea. Load the Admiral's bones into the cannon. We'll save this fool's life if we can." "You must be joking," the skeleton says, his tone no longer so abrasive. "The drunkard earned his fate the moment he drank himself dim." "As did you earn your fate," the Captain replies, "when you raised a banner against the Empire." She turns back to you. "We're three hundred ties away and closing fast. There's no time to argue.

Ironsworkers, Trackward Within the dense heart of Innocence Lost, the buildings climb atop each other like too many rats in too small a box. Numerous lines converge, cross, split, or run concurrently in a tangled mess of rails and switches. Fortunately, most of the tracks appear to run straight through town. The townspeople go about their business along the rails, slipping in and out of the tight spaces between buildings and stepping aside with disinterested expressions to let the Problem clatter by. Some shout insults against the Empire, and one particularly unruly skeleton throws a brick that grazes the Captain's hat. It's odd to see such a blatant display of treason, but you suppose that's what happens when the guard isn't around to keep the peace. You continue past the docking tracks. "Captain, might we dock and find a new anchor?" you ask, but the Captain shakes her head. "Without an anchor, there won't be enough track off the hotline to come to a stop. Safely, that is.
