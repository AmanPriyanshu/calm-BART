You'd forgotten that beneath the pearl blue and clouds, it looks more like this: square buildings stacked on concrete like boxes in a garage. The ground is cracked, as are the bricks of the building. Puddles have collected by the cracks, grayer than water should be. A sign by a metal door reads ~TRUCKS ONLY~, but it's far too late for any to be around; the door's closed anyway.

A long paste table is standing here. A white table-cloth has been draped over it, to give it some glamour. The result, contrary to IF conventions, is quite good. Champagne glasses are arranged on it in neat rows. On the table is a glass of champagne. A Thomson's gazelle is standing here, swaying a bit, gently licking Champagne from the long glasses.
