[STATE] Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0. tadsr - A text-only TADS 2.5.10 Interpreter. Copyright (c) 1993, 2006 by Michael J. Roberts. Do you want to read the introduction?  (YES or NO) > [ACTION] yes [STATE] On an ancient, crumbling clay tablet lie the words writ by a wise Assyrian scribe some 4000 years ago:  "The gods do not subtract from the alloted span of men's lives the hours spent on fishing."  It is in the spirit of these words that you have gone into your garage, unearthed the fishing equipment passed down to you by your father, and called in sick for several days so that you may seek the pleasure of one of the oldest sports known to humanity. You drive into a national park well known for its fishing, and, parking your vehicle and yourself by a crowded lake, proceed to bring in a haul as large as your permit allows you.  But as the days go by, you feel that the challenge of rod and reel has left.  You find yourself limply tossing back the fish you so easily hooked upon your line.  You look within that part of your soul that has to do with fishing, and come up with void. In frustration, you somehow wander into an old general store by the lake.  A century ago it was owned by a man whose name is now nearly illegible on the sign; today it is a concession stand for fast food. Still, mingling with the smell of hamburgers and fries are a group of graybeards, sitting on the porch and talking about days gone by. You find yourself engrossed in their conversation, about catches of yesteryear, and struggles against the mighty fish of the past.  And, always mentioned in hushed whispers, is a legendary fish called only "The Old One."  Fifty, perhaps a hundred or two hundred pounds, long as the tallest pine and wilder than the savage bear of the forest, and appearing only once every thirty years, The Old One has defied the fishing poles of men for centuries.  "They even say," says one man, "The Old One even carried away the bride-to-be of ol' Bob of the bait store, though he never really believed it.  That I heard when I was a boy of five, that I did!"  There are chuckles all around. After an awkward silence, one of the men says, "But The Old One only appears once every thirty years, don't it?"  "Uh-huh," replies another.  "In fact, it's appearing this year, ain't it?"  There are more chuckles all around as you quietly excuse yourself from their company. That night you toss and turn in your tent as visions of The Old One swim in your mind.  You are almost out of bait and money, but perhaps, just perhaps, you might have a chance.  And so, at five o'clock in the morning, you slip away from camp, with only a rod, tackle box and thermos of coffee in hand, down the trail the old men told you about. You feel the thrill of fishing return to you as you make your way down to Lake Highwater.  Somehow, you think, you will succeed where others have failed.  You are sure that The Old One will not be...

On the west wall there is a curtain behind the counter leading into some back room, and upon the counter there is an old wooden bucket as well as a plastic receptacle.  By the entrance of the store, to the east, is a small collection of old photos, depicting champion fishermen. Bob is here, minding the store.

Bob emerges from the back room with a photo in his hands.Bob is handing you the photo when he takes a closer glance at it.  "Why, why..."  he stammers.  Suddenly he turns white and looks as if he's about to collapse.  You rush behind the counter to help him, but he recovers enough to thump himself several times in the chest.  Shaking his head as if to clear his mind, he stares at the photo again. "It's The Old One!"  he gasps.  "Look at it!  That's the largest bluegill I ever saw!" "Um, a bluegill?"  you ask."Yeah," says Bob, pointing out some features on the fish.  "you can tell by the..."  His voice trails off, and you realize that a biology lesson is right now not the most important thing about the moment. "Nellie," says Bob with a sigh.  "I know that's The Old One, because..."  He points to the golden bracelet around The Old One's tail.  "Because that's Nellie's bracelet.  It was just like Zeke said. I guess...she didn't really leave me for that rich guy after all.  She never intended to." "Um, I'm sorry," you say, not knowing what to say. "You should be!"  Bob snorts, life coming back to him.  "You have The Old One *that* close, and ya let it get away!  Young whippersnappers nowadays, they're as feeble as I thought." But Bob's tone cheers up as he slips the photo under the counter. "Still, I have to congratulate you on what ya did.  Before 1935, no one had a better picture of The Old One than this.  I always wanted ta see The Old One with my own eyes, and I didn't want to die before I did." "Wait a second," you say.  "This doesn't mean you're not going to..." "Of course not!"  says Bob.  "Just because I done near had a heart attack when I saw that picture doesn't mean I'm going to keel over and die after I've achieved my ambition of seeing that blasted fish!  I'm gonna wait, right here, until someday someone brings in The Old One, straight from the water, to this here bait shop!  Maybe I'll even try it myself!"  You find yourself in awe at the old man's grim determination.  "Besides," he says, shoulders slumping a fraction of an inch, "if I don't live, who's gonna take care of poor Zeke's 170 year-old great-grandmother when he dies?" And so your fishing odyssey at Lake Highwater comes to an end.  Out of bait (as your cheese ball has dissipated into its component gases) and money, you pack your belongings and get ready to leave.  As you amble happily out of the bait store, ready for the long hike home, you cast one more glance at the beautiful blue surface of Lake Highwater.  You spot a shape in the middle, and strain for a second to take a look. It's The Old One, leaping high into the air, as if to bid you farewell, the golden bracelet around its tail gleaming in the sunlight.  You smile and nod, and find yourself saluting this rugged fish, all the while, thinking, "In thirty years!  I'll be back!" As if to acknowledge the receipt of your challenge, The Old One waves its shiny tail at you and disappears beneath the surface of Lake Highwater. In a total of 153 turns, you have achieved a score of 20 points out of a possible 20. You may restore a saved game, start over, quit, undo the current command, or see a list of things to do in this game for your amusement.
