Its scarves flutter behind like stage flames as it drifts closer. The angel hovers several yards past the railing of the balcony. Its androgynous smile is hard, carved from rock candy. It reaches into a red box tucked beneath its arm, and then casts its hand towards you, like it is feeding grain to chickens. Red-black flakes fall on your face, sink into your skin.

Or the, what was that thing, a store mannequin rigged up with a red spotlight and dangling on a zip line?" "The fake plague angel was totally Lorenzo's idea," says Camilla. "I made the papier-mâché corpse, too." Lorenzo shakes his head, wipes away tears of laughter. "My money," you say, holding out your hand. Lorenzo snorts. "You think I have that kind of cash? My dad keeps me on a strict allowance. I'm more broke than you." What a rotten day. Please press SPACE to continue. But a month later Lorenzo's dead, of the real Pestilence, and you are driving his father's cherry-red Aceto west towards Avignon.
