Bordering the waterfall is thick temperate rainforest vegetation: a canopy of tall myrtle and sassafras trees, beneath which are leatherwood and tree-ferns, all covered in moss, lichen, shell-fungus. The boy has his arm around the girl's shoulder. Both are wearing light bushwalking clothes, and he carries a day pack. The boy looks cocky and confident and wears an idiotic 'say cheese' grin. The girl is not smiling. This was not, as you recall it, that she had been unhappy, just unused to having her picture taken. "It's like giving away a piece of your soul," she had once joked. As it happens she had smiled just after the shot was taken; a small, nervous smile of relief (you mimic the smile at the memory). [ACTION] examine man

Bordering the waterfall is thick temperate rainforest vegetation: a canopy of tall myrtle and sassafras trees, beneath which are leatherwood and tree-ferns, all covered in moss, lichen, shell-fungus. The boy has his arm around the girl's shoulder. Both are wearing light bushwalking clothes, and he carries a day pack. The boy looks cocky and confident and wears an idiotic 'say cheese' grin.

You make the journey here once a week to sell old tools, books and assorted junk. The weekly market is set outdoors among the convict-built sandstone buildings near the city's waterfront - once warehouses, seedy pubs and brothels, but now mostly converted to art galleries, craft shops and caf?s. Beyond these colonial buildings and the modest high-rises behind them, you see the mountain - a stark and imposing backdrop to the city, and for once not covered in clouds. The surrounding stalls have brightly coloured awnings, making yours appear somewhat drab in comparison. To the south a busker plays a violin, while from the north come the strains of South American folk music played on guitar and pan-pipes. Nearby, a man dressed as a clown twists balloons into animal shapes. It's a hot day and the place is busy, though not for you. You haven't sold a thing all morning. To top it off, Nadia should be here helping with the stall, but you haven't seen her in nearly two days. You wonder what her excuse might be, this time.

You were on a night out with the boys and found yourself instantly hooked by her smile. It was a smile that lit up her face and almost made you go weak at the knees. That night was the beginning of a tempestuous casual relationship. Nadia looks for the hidden beauty in everything and everyone; believing in astrology, the healing powers of crystals and reincarnation (to her everyone has been someone in a former life). You, on the other hand, consider yourself to be practical and down-to-earth. Despite your differences, you initially found Nadia's optimism refreshing - were almost prepared to believe that you had known each other previously (in a Biblical sense, and era) and enjoyed being called Akhnaten: "my little sun king" (to her Nefertiti). Within a few months of meeting, it was Nadia - while remarking on your tenseness, offering short-term relief through massage, then telling you to "be true to the creature you are" - who gave you the impetus to return to the mountain. You sold your business and moved together to a caravan on a steep block high in the foothills while building your bush home from mud brick, local stone and recycled materials. Later, to keep yourself busy, you began trading in second-hand furniture and junk (a passion for which you acquired in the course of getting the materials together for the house) and, much to Nadia's horror and chagrin, by cutting and selling firewood. ("Trees have feelings too, you know.") But recently things have not been going well. Nadia is beginning to tire of your scepticism, and you, of the Bohemian world she inhabits.

The photograph it contains is slightly overexposed and was taken using a flash. Depicted are a young man and young woman leaning with their backs to the rail of a rough wooden deck, backed by the spray of a narrow waterfall cascading down two tiers of mudstone outcrop. Bordering the waterfall is thick temperate rainforest vegetation: a canopy of tall myrtle and sassafras trees, beneath which are leatherwood and tree-ferns, all covered in moss, lichen, shell-fungus. The boy has his arm around the girl's shoulder. Both are wearing light bushwalking clothes, and he carries a day pack. The boy looks cocky and confident and wears an idiotic 'say cheese' grin. The girl is not smiling. This was not, as you recall it, that she had been unhappy, just unused to having her picture taken. "It's like giving away a piece of your soul," she had once joked. As it happens she had smiled just after the shot was taken; a small, nervous smile of relief (you mimic the smile at the memory). [ACTION] consider melanie

Your depression came years later, the onset gradual and seemingly without cause. You began to withdraw from the things and people around you, as though a filter had been placed between you and the rest of the world, or perhaps a small rip had developed in the fabric that bound you to it. Your fondness for the bush and those of the local community began to pale, and your recollections became tinged with sadness and regret. Over time you found it more difficult to keep your mind focused and you developed a propensity for self-doubt - doubts that led to failures, perceived as well as actual, that further fuelled your lack of confidence. Eventually, you fell into a descending spiral of despondency and despair, and the small rip in the fabric of your existence became a gaping rift. By the time you realised something had gone wrong, you were already powerless to do anything about it, and had nothing left to fight with. While still physically fit, you were an emotional cripple. And in this state, you would sit in your armchair for hours on end, wrestling inner demons, rerunning the events of your life in your mind, looking for someone or something to blame, before ultimately deciding that at some point in your life... ...you had taken a wrong turn. As you sit in the cabin of your Landcruiser, watching the snow fall through the frosted windscreen, you see a small boy standing on the dirt verge on the other side of the road.

[ACTION] press space [STATE] The discovery of the photograph had been largely fortuitous. Some time after the onset of your depression, you had been sitting in your armchair feeling choked by the clutter that surrounded you and had resolved to do something about it. Your clean up began with a dust covered cardboard box of old possessions from before your return to the mountain, and that was as far as you got. As you went through the contents of the box you came across a number of photographs scattered loose, among them the photo of Melanie and yourself at the waterfall. For a moment you had trouble recalling the photograph, where it had been taken, and even who the girl was that you were with. Then you remembered, and were instantly overwhelmed by feelings of melancholy and nostalgia. It was an almost palpable experience, like breaking open an exotic fruit and being immersed in the smell of its rich fleshy pulp - sickly sweet, but turning at the core. The scene in the photograph, which you had barely given a thought for years, was instantly transformed into a pivotal moment; while only one point in the millions that had made up your life, for you it became the critical one, the point where your life had started to go wrong. You made a frame for the photograph, and set it in a prominent position on the mantel. Over the following months you became more and more drawn to the picture, spent increasing amounts of time looking at it, running the frame through your hands, and running the events of that day and evening through your mind, thinking about how they might have been different. In time, you came to reinterpret everything that had happened before the day of the photograph as preparation for that moment and everything after as a mistake. Your waking hours were spent striving to regain the moment, and set it to rights in your mind. The world and your needs within it paled into insignificance, were merely inconvenient distractions from your true focus. And you became increasingly frustrated by the fact that with each passing hour you were a little further from the only junction in your life that had mattered, the only point where you could have put your life back on track... You open your eyes to find that you are once more lying on your back, feet together with arms folded across your chest. It is daylight and bright. You can hear the calls of birds outside. You feel strangely calm and rested, your breath coming easily and without pain. Even your hunger has abated. You have not forgotten the photograph lying in its shattered frame in the next room, but you don't feel pressed to do anything about it. There is no rush. A huntsman spider crawls along the beam above your head, towards a fly at the opposite end. The fly is caught in the strand of another spider's web, and it spins noisily and stupidly, like a fish on a hook. You are resigned to the fly's fate well before it is, and look away no longer interested before the spider reaches it. Bedroom (on the bed) This is your bedroom.

[STATE] The discovery of the photograph had been largely fortuitous. Some time after the onset of your depression, you had been sitting in your armchair feeling choked by the clutter that surrounded you and had resolved to do something about it. Your clean up began with a dust covered cardboard box of old possessions from before your return to the mountain, and that was as far as you got. As you went through the contents of the box you came across a number of photographs scattered loose, among them the photo of Melanie and yourself at the waterfall. For a moment you had trouble recalling the photograph, where it had been taken, and even who the girl was that you were with. Then you remembered, and were instantly overwhelmed by feelings of melancholy and nostalgia. It was an almost palpable experience, like breaking open an exotic fruit and being immersed in the smell of its rich fleshy pulp - sickly sweet, but turning at the core.

You feel as though you've been relieved of all your worries. Your approach to the activities of the day has been unhurried, and conducted with a degree of ceremony, as though in deference to fate. You really feel like Nadia's Egyptian king, with your final die cast and with organs safely tucked into jars, awaiting the arrival of the boat of Ra. You finish your meal and pick up the photograph. The changes in the scene have now become obvious - your head is fully turned towards the waterfall and your left arm is extended, pointing towards the top of the falls, while the smile on Melanie's face has gone, replaced by the beginnings of a frown.

[STATE] [The story read that as "take her"]. You can't see "her" (Melanie) at the moment. [ACTION] take bath [STATE] You fill the tub with warm water, then undress, leave the photograph on the floor well away from the water and have a long, leisurely bath. As you bathe you notice that the sensation of impeded movement is still there, but is much more pronounced than when you woke. It is almost as though your mind and body are operating at different speeds, with messages from your brain taking time to filter through your nervous system. After you've bathed and dressed you pick up the photograph, then take it to the armchair and sit with it on your lap. The couple at the waterfall are now facing each other. Melanie has her mouth open and you are now sure you can see the movement in the picture, although it is agonisingly slow. She is speaking and you silently mouth the words in anticipation of the horror of your worst mistake being repeated before your eyes. "No, you go. I'll wait here." Sweat pours from your hands and forehead and your heart is in your mouth as you watch for over an hour while the image of your younger self removes the day pack from his shoulder and hands it to Melanie. As the broad grin begins to appear on the face of the boy, you desperately wish you could reach into the scene to wipe away the conceited expression and shake some sense into the young fool. You wait with resignation for the boy to turn and start up the track to the top of the falls, but for a long time he just stands there unmoving - then by degrees he moves towards the girl and puts his arm around her waist. Only when the boy has taken the pack and the pair begin walking back along the track together do you start to breathe normally. This, you know, is how it was meant to be. As you sit in your armchair you look up from the photograph and notice that the fire is getting low. Living Room (East) (in the armchair) Your living room is full of clutter.

Throughout the rest of the day you sit there following the couple's slow progress back along the track. You afford yourself a wry chuckle as the startled pademelon bounds across the path in front of them - Melanie jumping and the boy comforting her, then their laughter at the episode. You can almost feel the shape of her through her clothes, the sparkle and comfort of her presence beside you. The rate of change in the photograph has increased steadily through the day, more a slow motion movie than portrait by day's end. While it is hard to drag yourself away, in time you find yourself too tired to go on watching the scene. Living Room (East) (in the armchair) Your living room is full of clutter.
