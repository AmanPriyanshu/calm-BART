That seemed a bit of a contradiction, but my thoughts on how to incorporate that was to imply that the merchant had just started to restore his herd (which is why he had only one). Now of course, since his business has been ruined, the wedding is very stressful.

I wanted to make the merchant's mirth seem hollow and shadowed by economic worry, but I felt that the cloud would have had trouble picking up on or caring about that subtle nuance, which is why the formal title of the father is "wealthy merchant".

[ACTION] north [STATE]  O NODE12 I never wanted to rely on players to know all the bits of history about the plague/plagues, but one part of the story was too interesting not to reference semi-blindly. According to the story, this firstborn-death-plague was only to be a punishment if the Pharaoh refused to free the Israeli slaves. The Pharaoh had actually firmly agreed to allow the Israeli Exodus, but then Yahweh "hardened Pharaoh's heart" (mentally bewitched Pharaoh) and forced him to continue holding them captive so that "God's wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt" (so that God could show off) (Exodus 4:21, Exodus 11:10). This, I think, is the most cruel of all the firstborn deaths: imagine being forced under an enchantment to cause the death of your own child. I initially gave the job of heart-hardening to one last small wisp of the cloud's consciousness, but it was too much trouble trying to explain what was going on (and detracted from the events going on at the moment), so I dropped that. I also semi-blindly referenced the spoiling/looting of Egypt ("and ye shall spoil the Egyptians" Exodus 3:22), another aspect of the story that I think is not as well known. I gave that job to the cloud, even though it seems as though the spoiling was carried out by the Israelites, just to give the finale a perversion on the traditional Triumph of Riches adventure game ending.

Whatever you may think about the rest of The Bible is irrelevant, but treating this as any other historical event claim, we can check the Egyptian records and see that Egypt did not have a period of strife where they were beset by bloody water, lice, flies, death of all cattle, hail, locusts, frogs, boils, unnatural darkness, or a systemic death of firstborns (and the Egyptians kept very good written records). Surely this would have been important enough to write down, especially since in the story Yahweh claimed these miracles were to impress upon the Egyptians His awesome power (Exodus 9:14), but there are no such Egyptian documents. Interestingly, It's likely that even the large population exodus from Egypt never happened to begin with, as Egypt doesn't have a record of hundreds of thousands of Hebrew slaves (Numbers 1:46) living in Egypt for a period of 400 years(Exodus 12:40).* Furthermore, the archaeological evidence for the origin of the Israelites themselves does not support an exodus, but rather a tribal formation from within or near Canaan, as they have similar pottery and alphabets. There have been many attempts to rationalize and explain how the plagues could have happened historically/scientifically from people who have a vested interest in the story being literally true, but many of those attempts require stretches of the imagination, and a comfort with a lack of good records. But there's not really a reason to take those rationalizations seriously until better documented corroborating evidence is brought up (again, like the extra-biblical evidence for the sieges of Jerusalem). So we can rest assured that while this is a very scary story, it is likely just that - a story. *The Egyptians did not use foreign slaves to create their pyramids, but instead a labor tax was imposed on local workers during the farming off season.
