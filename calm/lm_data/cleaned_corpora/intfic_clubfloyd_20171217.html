[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.  [ACTION] begin journey [STATE]  Good afternoon, Owl. Or good morning, evening, or night, since I shouldn't care to hazard a guess as to your time zone. But be that as it may. It is I, Amelia Derringer! I flatter myself to think that you may have heard of me; I'm the infamous thief who has been delighting and terrorizing England for three years now. As you undoubtedly know, I'm no ordinary sneak-thief. I became a cat burglar after acquiring an uncanny ability to shape-shift. All I need to do is eat a bit of an animal, and I can harness some small fraction of its special powers. It's served me well in my many successful burglaries, and I've acquired a reputation as a master thief, along with a lot of other people's money. But now I'm in a bit of a pickle, you know. Here I am, suspended in a cage over a slavering octopus. It's not something that would ordinarily confound me, of course, but I'm afraid I've mislaid my bag of thief tools---or rather, I had it mislaid for me by one of Rex Dashing's confounded robots. If it's not too much of a bother, would you be so kind as provide some sort of advice? I'd rather like to escape this cage, make my way through the airship, and help myself to a few cuttings of the Telepathic God-Slug of Madagascar. My research indicates that Rex Dashing keeps its body somewhere about his airship. Aquarium (in the steel cage) As cliché as it is, I'm trapped in a cage being slowly lowered into a tank. This particular tank is at least occupied by a vicious octopus rather than a horde of piranhas or sharks, which I suppose is at least mildly original. There is a prominent red button on the wall here, tantalizingly out of reach. There's also an exit south and a trapdoor overhead, though neither one is going to be useful to me until I get out of this accursed cage. One of the tentacles of that dratted beast is slurping over the edge of the cage! I trust you have something clever in mind. Line 1> Line 1> > EAT TENTACLE All right, if you insist... Well, that was certainly distasteful. I'm not sure I got more than a mouthful of slime, or ichor, or whatever the deuce you call it. I do seem to have come over all rubbery, though.

The Slug has no loftier ambitions for its power than confusing predators, but I plan to use it to establish a new world of peace and cooperation.

That was the idea, anyway. While I was bantering with Dashing over dinner, I accidentally tipped my hand. I don't think he ever realized the significance of the God-Slug; to him, it was just another trophy from his adventures. He figured out I was up to something, though, and had his robots drag me down here and---well, you know the rest. I need your help, Owl, to complete my mission.

The bleating mass of humanity said it couldn't be done, but once again I've proved them WRONG with my ATOMIC JETPACK. As enjoyable as it is to whoosh through the air, though, I have a mission to complete. Once I'm back on the airship and out of the clutches of my treacherous robots, I'll explain in a bit more detail. Let me gently land on the main deck... Excellent! Disregard the crash you may have heard, Owl; that was just me gently brushing up against a bookcase during my VICTORY DANCE on having accomplished such a perfect landing. And no, there is of course no bookcase on the main deck of the ship. Instead, I used my SPECTACULAR INTELLECT to reroute to a side room off the main deck because...well, to gain the element of surprise. My plan is running smoothly and COMPLETELY ACCORDING TO PLAN. Ah, yes, my plan. I'm sure you've been wondering, Owl, how a feckless idiot like Dashing could have such a technical marvel at his disposal. He didn't design or build it himself, of course; this is MY AIRSHIP. This is MY SHIP, MY ROBOTS, and MY NUCLEAR REACTOR. The last point is the most important one. Dashing stole my airship and has been trying to pass it off as its own, but that won't do him any good if it's destroyed in a FIERY NUCLEAR EXPLOSION. My plan is to sabotage the reactor and destroy the ship, then safely escape. That way, I can challenge him to rebuild it; it would be easy for him if he truly designed it in the first place. He didn't, of course, and I can expose his perfidy and incompetence when I rebuild my PERFECT AIRSHIP. Then the world will be laughing at the ridiculous "Captain" Dashing, and I will use my rebuilt ROBOT ARMY to crush him and then crush the WORLD! It is, of course, a perfect plan; now I just need to carry it out. As you undoubtedly know, I possess an uncanny immunity to radiation, which helps me immensely as a NUCLEAR SCIENTIST. My main ability, though is my amazing intelligence. I've been told, Owl, that you are the only person capable of matching my own staggering intellect. Let's see what you can do. Control Room I'm in the robot command area of the ship, its innermost cortex from which Dashing directs MY automata. Pfaugh! The lout! The electromechanical computation engine seems to be in recent repair, fortunately. Ah, and there's the bookshelf, where the technical manuals and programmer's notes are meant to be stored. The aft exit leads back to the main deck. [Your fee has just gone up by $1 million.] Line 2> Line 2> > X SHELF Does Dashing's arrogance know no bounds? He's stocked his bookshelf with cheap dime novels about his own adventures. As a SCIENTIFIC GENIUS, I had the foresight to stash a special item in the bookcase for emergencies such as this.

[STATE] Line 2> > PUSH BUTTON Ah, yes! Spectacular! Professor Dirk Radon, the IRRADIATABLE MAN, is once again free from the constraints of gravity! The bleating mass of humanity said it couldn't be done, but once again I've proved them WRONG with my ATOMIC JETPACK. As enjoyable as it is to whoosh through the air, though, I have a mission to complete. Once I'm back on the airship and out of the clutches of my treacherous robots, I'll explain in a bit more detail. Let me gently land on the main deck... Excellent! Disregard the crash you may have heard, Owl; that was just me gently brushing up against a bookcase during my VICTORY DANCE on having accomplished such a perfect landing. And no, there is of course no bookcase on the main deck of the ship. Instead, I used my SPECTACULAR INTELLECT to reroute to a side room off the main deck because...well, to gain the element of surprise. My plan is running smoothly and COMPLETELY ACCORDING TO PLAN. Ah, yes, my plan. I'm sure you've been wondering, Owl, how a feckless idiot like Dashing could have such a technical marvel at his disposal. He didn't design or build it himself, of course; this is MY AIRSHIP. This is MY SHIP, MY ROBOTS, and MY NUCLEAR REACTOR. The last point is the most important one. Dashing stole my airship and has been trying to pass it off as its own, but that won't do him any good if it's destroyed in a FIERY NUCLEAR EXPLOSION. My plan is to sabotage the reactor and destroy the ship, then safely escape. That way, I can challenge him to rebuild it; it would be easy for him if he truly designed it in the first place. He didn't, of course, and I can expose his perfidy and incompetence when I rebuild my PERFECT AIRSHIP. Then the world will be laughing at the ridiculous "Captain" Dashing, and I will use my rebuilt ROBOT ARMY to crush him and then crush the WORLD! It is, of course, a perfect plan; now I just need to carry it out. As you undoubtedly know, I possess an uncanny immunity to radiation, which helps me immensely as a NUCLEAR SCIENTIST. My main ability, though is my amazing intelligence. I've been told, Owl, that you are the only person capable of matching my own staggering intellect. Let's see what you can do.
