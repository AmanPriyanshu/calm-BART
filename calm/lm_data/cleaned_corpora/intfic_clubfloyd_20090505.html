Back south is a long corridor. Joe the janitor saunters in from the east corridor.  "Well, there it is!" he exclaims.  "I've been looking for that."  He removes the Cosmetic from your hand with a frown of reproach.  "I know you scientists are the bigwigs here, but I wish you'd ask first." "Say, Dr. Kurner, are you ill?"  He smiles.

A smooth ramp snakes around it on a gentle incline up to the higher levels - no stairs here, the robots not being that adept - and on a normal day the floor around would be crowded with scientists, like worshippers at a standing stone.
