[STATE] You are at the start of your journey.

It stays there for three hours, tempting adventurers to brave its dangers before disappearing at midnight for another year. It is said that Ghosterington's last four poems - the worst he ever wrote, now worth millions of dollars - are still inside the manor. But nobody has lived to bring them out.

Three rapidly approaching dark shapes swing into view and you open fire - BLAOW BLAOW BLAOW! The three clipped bats flap and flail as they tumble to their deaths hundreds of feet below.
